         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">G</seg>Od deſires ſo cordially and ſeeks ſo ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſtly our ſalvation, that He calls it <hi>his worke and his affaire</hi> by excellence; His Son <note place="margin">
                  <hi>Io</hi> 4. 34.</note> ſayd to his Diſciples <hi>I have meat you know not: Tis to do the will of my Father, and to accomplish his worke;</hi> And to his Mother in the Temple: <hi>Knew you not that I muſt labour in the affaires of my Father?</hi> And in the Vigil of his death: <hi>Father I have ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>complished the worke, you have given me to do.</hi> Becaus 'tis the worke of workes: the affaire of affaires, and the ayme, and end of other workes. He employes in it not men only, but alſo Angells. All the Angelicall Spirits that are ſent <note place="margin">
                  <hi>Heb.</hi> 1. 14.</note> into this world, are ſent for the ſalvation of the Elect, ſays S Paul.</p>
            <p>What ſay I men and Angells? He employes in it his divine Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections; For if He exerciſeth his Power in working miracles: Wiſdom in inventions to convert us: Patience in expecting us to penance: Goodneſs to allure us: Iuſtice to frighten us: Mercy in pardoning us, Providence in removing occaſions of ſin: 'tis for our ſalvation.</p>
            <p>And to the end there be nothing in Him, or of Him that is not employ'd in this great work: He ſends the adorable Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons that proceed from him.</p>
            <p>He ſends his beloved Son: who applyes himſelf to it with ſo great tenderness and affection, that from thence He takes his name: with ſo much fervour and Zeal, that he ſpends in it his ſweat and blood.</p>
            <p>He ſends the holy Ghoſt, who shews likewiſe His Zeal; when our ſalvation is in danger, we being in the ſtate of ſin, what does He not to draw us out of it, and to convert us? He excites us: wakens us: threatens us: importunes us: knocks almoſt inceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſantly
<pb facs="tcp:108789:3"/> at the doores of our hearts<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and if we open them to Him, He Enters into our ſoules: dwells in them: animates them: governs and conducts them: workes by them our good workes: in our prayers, He prayes, cryes, groanes in us, and by us<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> in temptations He aydes us: in perplexities, Enlightens us: in afflictions, comforts us.</p>
            <p>May not the Eternal Father ſay, <hi>Quid debui facere vineae meae &amp; non feci?</hi> What should I have don for the ſalvation of men that I have left undon? He hath deſired it moſt earneſtly: He hath deſign'd to it his creatures: Employ'd in it his Servants, Favourits, infinite Perfections: and the divine Perſons of his Son, and of his holy Spirit.</p>
            <p>How coms it to paſs then, that ſo few are ſaved, even amongſt Chriſtians? One reaſon is, that very many are yet ignorant of the ways ordinain'd by God to go to heaven. Another is, that the greater part alſo of the Faithfull, are negligent and careleſs in the uſe of the means preſcribed to be ſaved: they will not labour and ſtrive to enter by the narrow gate, and therefore our Saviour ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es they shal not. Wherefore deſiring the ſalvation of every one with all my heart, I shew the Firſt and put before their eyes, the plain and open wayes to Heaven; and to correct the negligence of the other, I add the moſt preſſing and urgent motives to walke and run in thoſe wayes.</p>
            <p>Peruſe this worke (good Reader) with the ſame intention and deſire that I preſent it to you. Conſider not who made it: nor how 'tis made: but what is therein ſayd to you. If you shal becom more knowing in the Faith and Law of Chriſt: and in ptactiſe more Dutifull to Him: it will abundantly recompen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ce the labour of</p>

            </head>
            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">A</seg>Mongſt the noble actions which the holy Penitent David practiſed to appeaſe God and ſatisfy his juſtice, This is one of the moſt notable: <hi>Docebo iniquos vias tuas, &amp; impij ad te convertentur:</hi> I will teach ſinners thy wayes, my God: and the impious shal be converted to Thee. Theſe words shew me how to do well this worthy fruit of Penance; I muſt not flatter: I muſt not tickle eares: but I muſt teach: <hi>Docebo.</hi> And whom muſt I teach? The poor as well as the rich: the little and ignorant, as well as the great and learned, my ſelf alſo as well as others; for we are all ſinners: and I muſt teach ſinners, <hi>iniquos.</hi> And what is it that I muſt teach? Not the conceits of Plato: not the diſcourſes of Ari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtotle, but thy wayes, ô my God! <hi>Vias tuas,</hi> the ways by which we muſt go to Thee. And why muſt I teach? not to receive popular praiſe: Not to be eſteemed learned: but that ſinners be converted to thee ô my God! <hi>&amp; impij ad te convertentur.</hi> The wayes by which we go to God, are Faith, and the Myſteries which it teaches, Hope, Charity, Grace, good Works, the Commande<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, and the Sacraments. Theſe wayes, God aiding, I will open plainly, teach practically, and urge earneſtly: that ſinners may be converted into them, and unto God. And firſt I will con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:108789:6"/> the material object or the Myſteries of Faith, which the Apoſtles propoſe in their Creed to us, and begin with theſe words, <hi>I believe in God.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="2">2. That there is a God, nature teaches us, the Pagans them ſelves confeſſed it: and it is a thing ſo manifeſt, that the ſcripture tells us, that none but fools deny it.</p>
            <p n="3">3. This word <hi>God</hi> in the ſingular number teaches us that there is but one. And if he were not the only one, he would not be God: He would not be the Sovereign of all: his Empire would not be abſolute: nor his Dominion univerſal: ſince that a Corrival or Competitor, would have right to diſpute with Him, if not the ſuperiority or the preeminence, at leaſt equa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity and independence.</p>
            <p n="4">4. The Apoſtles ſay not only, <hi>I believe God:</hi> but <hi>I believe in God:</hi> and theſe two expreſſions are very different; for the firſt imports only an Act of Faith by which we believe that there is a God, and what does come from Him: as what He teaches us in the Scripture, and what the Church propoſes as revealed by Him. But the other ſignifys not only an act of Faith: but alſo of Hope, and Love. And we learn by this expreſſion that it is not enough for a Chriſtian to believe God: but he muſt moreover hope in Him, and love Him: and ſo diſtinguish himſelf from the wicked, and from the devill: who can believe that there is a God: and give credit to his word: but becaus they confide not in him, nor love him; they believe not in God.</p>
            <p n="5">5. But what is God? This Queſtion the diſciples of learned Epictetus made to him; who anſwered, my Children, if I could tell you what is God, either He would not be God, or I my ſelf should be God; He ſayd true, but he ſayd not enough: it is not only impoſſible to explicate what is God: but whatſoever we can ſay of Him is infinitely below what we ought to ſay of Him, Wherefore S. Auſtin ſays, that we cannot ſay any thing that is worthy to be attributed to God, becaus in this it is unworthy, that it is poſſible to be ſayd.</p>
            <p n="6">6. Nevertheleſſe we ought to speak of Him for to make Him known, and we muſt make Him known for to make Him to be loved
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:108789:6"/> and feared: and we muſt make Him to be loved and feared, for to avoyd ſin which offends Him.</p>
            <p n="7">7. The Scripture ſays that He is great and above all praiſe, <hi>Magnus Dominus &amp; laudabilis nimis.</hi> But we muſt not imagin that it <note place="margin">
                  <hi>Pſal.</hi> 47. 2.</note> ſpeaks of a material and corporeal greatneſſe. When we ſay that one King is greater then another: this is not to ſay, that he is of a greater and higher ſtature: but that he is greater in Power, and Dominions: ſo when we ſay, that God is great, we mean not in material quantity, length, largneſſ, and other corporeal dimenſions; for He is a ſpirit, and has no body, nor parts; But He is great in Nobility, in Power, in Wiſdome, in Goodneſſ, and other divine Petfections.</p>

But God is ſo powerfull, that He can not only reduce all things to nothing, but draw all things out of nothing, even without any aſſiſtance, without any labour, and more eaſily then you look upon me; for you may be wearied in looking on me, or hindred

He makes likewiſe to contribute to the Exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cution of his Will, and to the accomplishment of his intentions: all that men do againſt his Will, and all that oppoſes his intentions; the impious do all they can to diſhonour Him: the infidells to ruine his Church: the reprobate to afflict and deſtroy his Elect: and He makes the attempts of the impious to conduce to his glory: the infidelity of the infidells to the good of his Church: the perſecutions of the reprobare, to the ſalvation of the elect. What an ineffable wiſdom?</p>

            <p>Let us make an end of ſpeaking of Him whoſe greatneſſ has no
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:108789:8"/> end, who is infinite in his Eſſence, and infinite in Perfections; for 'tis to mafle as infants, 'tis to obſcure his perfections to ſpeak of them ſo imperfectly: and if He were not infinitely mercifull and condeſcendent it would be a punishable temerity, to ſpeak ſo lowly, ſo groſſly, and ſo unworthily of Him. Yet this is enough to make us ſee what a Majeſty we offend, and whom we make our enemy, when we commit a mortal ſin. And after this, shal we not endeavour to conceive a lively repentance of our ſins? shal we content our ſelves with a little ſorrow, and which regards nothing but our own intereſts? if we deteſt our ſins, becauſe they rob us of our merits, ſubject us to the tyranny of the devill, engage us to Eternal damnation; if we have no other motive, 'tis to feel and reſent a ſcratch of a pin which we have received, and not a great ſtroake of a ſword which we have gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven; The injuries that ſin does to the Creatour, are without compariſon greater, then thoſe which it does to the Creature.</p>
            <p n="16">16. For to avoyd them then, Let us remember that God is infinitely noble. If a Prince, tho' a ſtranger that appertains not at all to us were in this Country, we would not abuſe or injure him, but would honor him and treat him with reſpect; and shal we dare to offend our God, our Sovereign, the King of Kings? This King who is ſo great that all the Kings of the earth in reſpect of Him are but ſlaves, and wormes of the earth.</p>
            <p>Let us conſider, that He is infinitely powerfull. We fear to offend the Powers of this world, becauſe they can punish us, deprive us of our liberty, eſtates, or temporal life; and shal we dare to offend the omnipotent God, who by one word, one act of his Will, can reduce us to duſt; who after He has killed the body, will caſt our ſoules into Eternal flames?</p>
            <p>Let us conſider that He is infinitely Wiſe: that all things ly open to his ſight, that he can not forget any thing: that whatſoever excuſe we forge for to flatter our conſcience, and to diminish the greatneſs of our offenſes, He ſees the greatneſs of them: He knows all the circumſtances of them, and pierceth the bottome of our hearts: He knows that 'tis neither violence, nor poverty, nor neceſſity that makes us to commit ſin: but that 'tis becauſe we have not the fear of God, nor the due love of him.</p>
            <pb n="7" facs="tcp:108789:8"/>
            <p> Let us conſider that He is good, and that He has always been ſo to us. Tis a great injuſtice, a very unnatural malice to offend a perſon that has never given us any cauſe, who has never diſoblig'd us all his life. We know that 'tis God who created us, who conſerves us at preſent, and hath preſerved us from a thouſand dangers: He who hath given us more than we have deſir'd, more than we should dare to deſire: and what is above all deſire, who has given his own life; and died upon the Croſs by pure charity towards us. After all theſe graces, shal wee have the malice to commit a mortal ſin, which infinitely diſpleaſes Him?</p>
            <p>Let us remember that He is infinitely juſt, and that his juſtice ought to have its cours; His Prophet ſayd I <hi>feared all my</hi> 
               <note place="margin">
                  <hi>Iob.</hi> 9. 82.</note> 
               <hi>works knowing that thou wouldeſt not ſpare the offender,</hi> He leaves not unpunished the leaſt failings; what will he do then to mortal ſins, to great Crimes? We muſt hold it then as moſt certaine, that if we commit theſe ſins, we shal ſuffer ſoon or late moſt bitter and grievous torments in this world or in the other.</p>
            <p>Let us in fine conſider, that He is independent, that He depends not of any one in his Being, nor in his deſigns, nor in his operations: that if He aſſociate ſometimes his creatures in the Execution of his deſigns, 'tis by an Exceſs of goodneſs, and not out of indigence. If He could have need of us, we might thinke that He would be obliged to pardon us, and to ſeek our amitie, But he needs us not; He has been well without us from all Eternity: he will be well without us for all Eternity: and if we honour not his mercy in heaven, we ſhal honor his juſtice by our ſufferances in hell, from which I pray God to keep us by his mercy. Amen</p>

               <hi>The Father Almighty, Creatour Of Heaven and Earth.</hi>
            </head>
            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>He firſt verity expreſſed in theſe words requires as much vertue and ſtrength of Faith as any other Verity revealed; It obliges us to believe and adore a pluralitie of divine Perſons in a moſt perfect Unitie of nature: and to Confeſſ that in the Diety there is a Perſon who intelle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctually produces a coeternal and conſubſtantial Son. Hence the Apoſtles truly call Him <hi>Father;</hi> and his Paternity or fatherhood is ſo proper to Him, that 'tis not an Attribute or Quality: but that which enters the intrinſecal and individual conſtitution of Him.</p>
            <p>Father alſo of us: becauſe he created us, conſerveth us at preſent, and nourisheth us.</p>
            <p>Father again, becauſe he redeemed us by his own Son, makes us his Children by adoption, governs, and directs us, and conducts us to the inheritance of eternal life.</p>
            <p n="2">2. <hi>Almighty</hi> or <hi>Omnipotent:</hi> This ſignifies a perfection not ſo proper to him, as is that of <hi>Fathêr.</hi> Omnipotence alſo is not his particular Attribute or Quality, but to him appropriated and attributed. You know that the faith of the church adores three Perſons ſubſiſting in the Divinity<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> You know that Divinity acknowledgeth and reverenceth in God three principal Perfections:
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:108789:9"/> 
               <hi>Power, Wiſdom, Goodneſs:</hi> You know that the Scriptures and the Fathers doe attribute to each one of theſe Divine Perſons, one of theſe Perfections, tho' all three be common to them all. <hi>Omnipotence</hi> to the Father, becauſe He is the ſource and origin of Divinity. <hi>Wiſdom,</hi> to the Son, becauſe He is begotten by the way of underſtanding and of knowledg: <hi>Goodneſs,</hi> to the Holy Ghoſt, becauſe. He is produced by the way of Will and Love. Theſe are three Divine Perſons which inſeperably and indiviſibly applyd themſelves to the Creation, to the Conſervation, and to the Government of the Univers: Theſe are the three fingers of God, as the Prophet I ſay calls them, who ſuſtaine, conſerve, and govern the world: Thoſe are their three infinite Perfections which are apply'd unto this worke; For if we conſider the matter out of which the World was drawn, we ſhal admire an infinite Power: If we conſider the manner in which the World is governed, we shal acknowledge an incompre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>henſible Wiſdom: If we conſider the End to which this World is deſigned, we shal ſee and love an ineffable Goodneſſ.</p>
            <p n="4">4. Firſt we shal admire an infinite Power; For if there were ſo Excellent a workman that could make a Cup of gold of a lumpe of ſilver, he would be admired; but if he should make a golden Cup of a maſs of lead, he would be a workman far more Excellent; and yet more, if he should make it of a barre of Iron; and yet more, if he made it of a piece of wood; but if he made it of a grain of ſand, he would paſſ for a demy God, and we would ſay that his power is almoſt infinite. Ought he not than to be God indeed, and to have a power entirely infinite for to make, not a Cup of gold, but Heaven and Earth, Angells and men, and all the other Creatures, and to make them of nothing, as our God did, whom we confeſs in this Article to be the Creatour of Heaven and Earth?</p>
            <p n="5">5. If his Divinity and his infinite Omnipotencie appeare ſo Clearly in the matter of which he made the world: his Divinity and his incomprehenſible Wiſdom appears yet more, in the manner by which he governs it. This Wiſdom, ſay I, ſhines ſo brightly, in the conduct of the Univers, that we need not but to open our Eyes for to ſee it as clear as the day; For we ſee that the
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:108789:10"/> Heavens turne about us, in ſo regular, ſo conſtant, and ſo unvariable an order: that the ſeaſons of the year ſerve us by quarters: and that they ſucceed one another with a viciſſitude ſo proportioned to our life. We ſee that the animalls that have not judgement, and alſo that the plants which have not ſenſe, performe all their functions, with ſo much induſtry and perfection, and commodity for our ſervice, as if they had judgment. All this makes us to conclude, that there muſt be in the Univers a Sovereign Wiſdome, a divine Spirit, moſt intelligent, and moſt provident, who rules, governs, and directs all theſe things: and who by an ineffable Goodneſs obliges them to ſerve us.</p>
            <p n="6">6. For God created all theſe things for us: He governs them all for us: and to ſhew us this his admirable Goodneſs, He created man the laſt of all as the End, to which He referred his works; For the end is always the firſt and the principall in the intention of the Workman, and the laſt in the Execution of the worke. And we experience to our great profit, that they all tend unto this End, and that they conſpire to ſerve and intertaine us; ſome to beare us: others to nourish, cloath, cure, and reioyce us.</p>
            <p>Tis then for you ô man! that the heavens move, that ſtarrs glitter, that fire warms, that air refreshes, that rivers run, that the earth produces fruits, that animalls live and labor; and it is for you in fine that God conſerves and employs all theſe Creatures, when you thinke leaſt of it: when you recreate: when you ſleep: when you injure and offend him: He then thinkes on you, He acts for you, and makes all Nature to labor and ſweat for you.</p>
            <p>He ſays to you, not by word, but by work, you diſoblige me extremely, you commit ſin which diſpleaſeth me infinitely: But nevertheleſs take the preſents which I make you: taſte and ſee that I am a ſweet Lord. For is it not to be very ſweet to give you ſo many ſweetneſſes and dainties in return to ſo many bitter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſes which you preſent me daily? Ha! we ceaſe not to offend him, and He ceaſes not to careſs us; what admirable Goodneſs! should we not be monſters of ingratitude, and abortives of nature, if our hearts be not ſoftened, and gained by ſo many favours?</p>
            <p n="7">
               <pb n="11" facs="tcp:108789:10"/> 7. Moreover we muſt note, that we are obliged to God for all the good He hath don to other creatures. When a Father employes a Tayler, nourishes him, payes him for his labor: gives him ſtuff to make a robe for his daughter: 'tis not the robe that is obliged to him; and if alſo the robe should have ſenſe and under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding it would not be much obligd to thanke him, ſince he hath not don all this to the robe, for love of the robe, but for love of his daughter; 'tis the daughter then that hath the obligation, and who ought to thank her father for it; ſo we are oblig'd to God, for all the beauty, goodneſs, qualities, and proprieties that He hath diſtributed among his creatures: becaus 'tis not for them, but for us, that He hath given them all theſe qualities and perfections: to the end we may thank him, prayſe him, love him, ſerve him, and keep his commandements: <hi>He gave them the Countries of Nations,</hi> Says the Royal Prophet, <hi>and</hi> 
               <note place="margin">
                  <hi>Pſal.</hi> 104. 44.</note> 
               <hi>they poſſêſſed the labours of people, that they might keep his juſtifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cations and ſeek his law.</hi> Ô how ill does he that ſerves not God! ô what injuſtice does he commit againſt his Creatour! Tis an inſuppor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table ingratitude not to acknowledg, honor, and love ſuch a Benefactor.</p>
            <p n="8">8. If you lett a poor Cottage to your neighbor, you will that he pay you rent for it: and if he should fail, you would cry out againſt him: How comes it then ſays S. Chriſoſtome, that you pay not the tribute of thanks to your great God; that you <note place="margin">
                  <hi>hom.</hi> 12. <hi>ad Rom.</hi>
               </note> ſerve him not cordially, who hath placed you in this world, in this glorious Pallace, which He built, and which wholy ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pertains to him?</p>
            <p>If you have a Vineyard which you neither made, nor planted, nor cultivated, but have received it by inheritance; letting it to a farmer, you will have the half, or the thirds of the fruits of it, though that the farmer be poor, and hath many Children. God hath lett you a Vineyard or field to farme, and how vouchſafe you not to pay him not only not the fourth part of the revenew of it, not alſo the tythe, perhaps not the twentieth part of the rent of it, but rather chuſe that your children make good cheer with it, that they give of it to this flatterer, or to this diſſolute companion, than to your God, who dies with hunger in the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of the poor? I know well that you excuſe your ſelves by
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:108789:11"/> the number of your children. But if your farmer should diſpence with himſelf from paying you your dues upon the ſame account, would you admit of his excuſe? S. Chyſoſtome ſends us to learn our leſſon of the beaſts, ſince that we put our ſelues in their predicament, and perhaps alſo below; learn your leſſon of your dog, ſayd this great Doctor, you have not ſo much of judgment, or at leaſt not ſo much of gratitude as your dog; for after you have given a morcel of bread to him, he flatters you, to thanke you in the beſt manner that he can, to excite you to continue your favour to him; and you who are indued with reaſon, who blame ſo much ingratitude in others, whilſt that God does feed and nourish you delicately, you thanke him not. What ſay I? we thanke h<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>m not, we offend him much, and many ways: Nay we abuſe the very benefits in offending him.</p>
            <p n="9">9. I ſay that we abuſe them; for we make them to revolt againſt the Creator, and we employ them to ſin againſt him. We uſe the light to read Romances, and other naughty books: the darkneſs of the night to Cover dishoneſt actions: the air to breath out diſſolute ſongs, the fruits of the earth, in glut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tony and drunkennes, cloaths and ſpoils of animalls, in vanites.</p>
            <p n="10">10. Jn this we do as a poor man that should throw money given him at the face of his benefactor for to hurt him; as a Commander, that should uſe his authority, to levie men for warr againſt his Sovereign; as a wife that should abuſe the preſents her huſband gave her, in pleaſing an Adulterer.

                  <hi>Oſee. c.</hi> 28.</note> there we ſee how God punishes it in this life: I <hi>gave them cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne, and wine, and oile which they ſacrificed to Baal. Therefore I wil take my corne, and my wine;</hi> He will ſend ſterility, famine, warr, and other publick afflictions; Wherefore a pious Doctor admonishes us very wiſely, that as often as we uſe the creatures, we ſhould imagin that they ſay to us theſe three words, <hi>Accipe, Redde, Cave:</hi> Take the benefit, returne ſervice, beware puniſhment.</p>
            <p n="11">11. <hi>Take the benefit:</hi> Receive the creatures as ſo many Talents which this great Maſter gives you to make good uſe of them: as ſo many Preſents, which this cordial Friend does make you for a teſtimony of his benevolence: and as ſo many burning coales
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:108789:11"/> which he heaps upon your head, for to heat you in his love.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Returne ſervice;</hi> Render ſervice and the fruit of your negotia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to ſo liberal a Maſter: thankes to ſo obliging a Benefactor: obedience ro ſo ſweet a Father: and love to a ſo faithfull Friend. In fine.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Beware puniſhment.</hi> Take heed that you incurr not the reproches and the punishments of the ungratfull. Take heed you be not like to thoſe unclean beaſts, which never lift up their eyes to him who beats down acorns to them, and which thinks not of but eating and grunting at one another.</p>
            <p>Beware to imitate them who content themſelves to uſe the creatures, or to ſpeak more properly, to enioy them, to make good cheer, and to take their pleaſures, without ever thinking in themſelues: to whome belongs this bread I eate, this air I bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ath, this fire which warms me, and this horſe that carries me.</p>
            <p>Take heed of failing to acknowledg from whence theſe benefits do com; you will be ungratfull in not acknowledging them; more ungratfull in forgetting them: but moſt ungratfull in abuſing them, and in uſing the benefits againſt the Benefactor; you will be a monſter of ingratitude, who would deſerve, not only to be deprived of the creatures, but alſo to be puniſhed by them. For God hath not put the creatures under our feet for to ſerve as ſnares and ſtumblingblocks to make us fall, but to ſerve us as ſtepps and ladders to mount up to the knowledg of him: He hath put them into our hands, not as arms to fight againſt him; but as inſtruments to work with them in his ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice; He hath put them before our eyes not as objects in which we may repoſe and place our laſt end: But as means and wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yes by which we may go to him, who is our ſovereign Good, and our ultimate Beatitude Amen.</p>

            <p n="4">4. The Prophets announced that the Meſſias would come: But S. Iohn Baptiſt proclaimed that He is come, and shewing him with his finger ſayd, <hi>Behold him.</hi> His teſtimony cannot be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſed by any reaſonable man: for He led an innocent and irreprehenſible life from his infancy; He was a diſintereſſed man, who contemned honours, riches, and the delights of the world. The perfection and ſanctity of his life is ſo eminent, that they take him for the Meſſias: and it was in him to be acknowledged for ſuch. All the Synagogue ſent to him Prieſts and Levites, for to know of him, if He were CHRIST or no; if He had anſwered but yes, they had believed his ſimple
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:108789:13"/> word giving teſtimony of himſelf; with more reaſon ought one to believe him when he teſtifys for another; He ſays, <hi>that he is unworthy to unty the shooſtring of his shoos:</hi> he hides himſelf ſo ſoon as IESUS begins to shew himſelf: and of ſo many Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples as he had, not any of them appears after IESUS began to preach.</p>
            <p n="5">5. But tho' the predictions of the Prophets, nor the teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony of the Precurſour should not authorize in any ſort the Miſſion of IESUS-CHRIST: the workes and miracles which He wrought shew evidently that He was ſent by God. When one affirms himſelf to be ſent extraordinarily from God, if he will that men believe him, he ought to give proofs of his Miſſion, to worke miracles, which are the bulls and patents of it; if he does evident, palpable, and irreprehenſible miracles, men ought to believe that he is ſent by God, and give credit to his words; for 'tis impoſſible that God should work a miracle in confirmation of a ly. JESVS shews then evidently and effectually that He is ſent by God, and that He is God, ſince that He works ſo many Miracles in confirmation of his Miſſion, and his Doctrine; He makes ſeen his power in all Orders of the Vnivers: He exerciſes his empire upon all that is in nature, and he works miracles u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pon all creatures, as appears in the writings of the Evangeliſts.</p>
            <p n="6">6. Now that theſe miracles were not impoſtures but truly wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked, many powerfull reaſons perſwade every man that hath com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon ſenſe. But this shal ſuffice at preſent, That the Evangeliſtes name often the perſons, they particularize circumſtances of pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ce and manner in which the miracles were wrought: and they write thoſe that were don in their time, in publick, and in the preſence of many witneſſes; if they had not ſayd the truth, they might eaſily be reproved, and they would have had thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſands that would have contradicted them, and who would have taken all credit from them, and from their Goſpells; They re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port that JESVS fed four thouſand perſons with ſeven loaves: and another time, five thouſand with five loaves; They ſay that JESUS raiſed Lazarus half rotten in <hi>Bethania,</hi> very neare to <hi>Hieruſalem:</hi> the child of the Widow in <hi>Naim</hi> at the gate of the City, in the ſight of very many; that they brought into Hieru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſalem
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:108789:14"/> the infirme of the neighbouring Towns, and that the ſhadow of S. Peter paſſing upon them, they were all cured; If theſe things were fals, when the Evangeliſts pteached, and pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blished their books, they would have had as many Witneſſes a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt them, as there were perſons in Naim, in Hieruſalem, and in the neighbouring Towns, who would have ſayd, we we<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>re then in the Town, we have neither ſeen nor heard any th<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of all this.</p>
            <p>They ſay that in the paſſion of JESUS CHRIST the ſun was eclipſed, that darkneſs covered all the earth, that the earth trembled, that the ſepulchers opened, that the Vail of the Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple was rent, and that this was done in the feaſt of Paſche, when rhere were in the City more than eleven hundred thouſand perſons according to the hiſtory of Ioſephus; theſe Perſons ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>me to the Feaſt from all parts of the world where the Iews were then diſperſed, as may be ſeen in Philo, Ioſephus, and Tacitus, and from thence they returned to their reſpective ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mes. If theſe miracles had not been true, there would have be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>en in every place, who would have depoſed againſt the Apoſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>les and the Goſpell which they brought with them: who would have ſayd to them: you are great lyars: we were that year in Hieruſalem, and we ſaw nothing of all this: they would have ſent them back into their counrrey with their books, But this happen'd not: for theſe miracles were ſo evident, ſo notorious, and confeſt of all the world: that the Apoſtles who preached them were received by all the world. The Goſpells which containe th<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>em being published; not one of the Phariſees, who were enra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged with ſpite againſt IESUS CHRIST and his Religion, ever da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red to contradict the narration of theſe miracles in the books which they compoſed; But on the contrary, all the enemies of chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian Religion, Iews, Mahometans, and Gentills, have acknow<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ledged theſe miraculous works.</p>
            <p n="7">7. As concerning the miracles of the Apoſtles and primitive chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians, <note place="margin">

               </note> which they wrought in the name of IESUS, they were ſo frequent and ſo evident, that Pagans not being able to reproach them by any artifice, attributed them to magick, as may be ſeen in S. Auguſtin. But to attribute them to Magick, is a malice
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:108789:14"/> as black and diabolical as magick it ſelf. For firſt Iulian the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtate, and ſo many others, who were ſo much affected and addicted to magicians and to magick, never could render ſight to one blind, or raiſe one only dead man. Secondly magick hath no po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wer but by the concurrence of the Devill: and how came it that he would aſſiſt the Apoſtles to do miracles, ſeeing that the Apoſtles by theſe miracles abolished the worship of the devills; But if you are ſo incredulous, that you will not belive any thing but what is before your eyes: believe a miracle which you ſee, the converſion of the world: and confeſs that IESUS CHRIST by himſelf, and by his Diſciples hath made in the world the grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſt, the hardeſt, and the beſt change that was ever made.</p>
            <p n="8">8. He hath made the true God, the God of Iſrael, who was not known but in Paleſtine, and to a few in the other parts of the earth, to be known and adored by all the world; He hath banished Idolatry, diſcredited the devills who abuſed men, ſilen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced their oracles, ruined their Temples, demolished their Altars broken their Idolls, abolished their ſacrifices, and annihilated their ſervice: He hath drawn men from murders, impurities, parricides and other abominations which they committed in the worſhip of theſe fals Gods: And what is yet more wonderfull, in the pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ce of this falſe worſhip, He hath planted and eſtabliſhed a new religion, tho' the more ſpeculative points of it appear contrary to the maxims of reaſon: The proper precepts and counſills of it pieces of great folly according to humane prudence, and the opinion of infidells: And the practiſe of it is the mortification, the croſs, and the crucifixion of a man.</p>
            <p n="9">9. The Iews and other Infidells muſt confeſs this at leaſt, that this change was a worke, which could not be accompliſhed but by a man not only ſent by God, but extraordinarily aſſiſted by him: ſince the ancient Prophets, who made ſo many invectives, gave ſo many threats, and worked ſo many miracles againſt Ido<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latry, could not yet baniſh it from one only kingdom of Egipt, one only City of Babilon, nor from any other pagan Town. Now this IESUS who is ſent by God, and extraordinarily aſſiſted by him: who negociates with ſo much ſucceſs the affairs of his glory, <note place="margin">
                  <hi>Iohn.</hi> 14. 6.</note> ſays that <hi>He is the Son of God,</hi> that <hi>He is the Way, and the Veritie,</hi>

            <p n="10">10. Let us ſay then with S. Philip, we have found the MESSIAS <hi>of whom Moyſes and the Prophet wrote:</hi> we have known him by certain and <note place="margin">
                  <hi>Iohn.</hi> 1. 45.</note> evident marks. But to what ſerves it to have known and received him, if inſtead of being our moſt good and amiable Redeemer, we by not practiſing his doctrine nor following his examples, do make him to be our moſt terrible and ſevere Judge? what profits us to have carried the name and character of Chriſtians, if neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lecting to be true Chriſtians, good and vertuous Chriſtians, we make by our fault, that JEsus, who was ſent to be out Father and our Paſtor, become to us a ſtumblingblock and an Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mie?</p>
            <p n="11">11. Let then every Chriſtian look upon his Doctrine as a Law; which obliges them: as a Rule to which they muſt conform their lives: as a Contract that God hath made with us, which contains conditions under which He promiſes us his Paradiſe, and not otherwiſe. When then you read in this Law, Rule, and Contract any verity, or have it otherwiſe propoſed to you: you muſt con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider it, ruminate upon it, and apply it to your ſelf, and to your actions: for God ſayd it expreſsly to you, and for this end.</p>
            <p>As when you read or hear. <hi>Vnleſs you bocom as little children, you shal not enter into the kingdom of Heaven.

<pb n="21" facs="tcp:108789:15"/> the maxims of the world: But according to that which is written in this Law and Rule, and that with ſo much exactneſs, that there shal not be one word, not one ſyllable, not one <hi>jota,</hi> that shal not be infallibly accomplished.</p>
            <p>And to ſay no more, behold an irrevocable ſentence of the eternal <hi>Verity,</hi> which no excuſe, no pretext, no reaſons can put off: <hi>They that obey not the Goſpell, shal undergoe eternal paines;</hi>

Wherefore in the firſt place we will ſee, what is IESUS-CHRIST to whom they give theſe names; And in the ſecond place, Why they give theſe names to him.</p>
            <p>What is CHRSIT? This is a Miſtery well known to many: But which ought not to be unknown to any: becauſe 'tis the foundation of Chriſtianity, And the Source of our ſalvation; And it oonſiſtes in this: that as in us there are two parts: the one interiour, inviſible, and Spiritual, which is the ſoule;
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:108789:16"/> The other exteriour, viſible, and material, which is the body; body and ſoul ſo knit togeather, that thay make but one thing which is man; So in our Saviour there are two Natures, one increa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, eternal, and infinite, to wit the Divinity; the other crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, temporal, and finite, to wit the Humanity, that is to ſay, a body and a reaſonoble ſoul; which Divinity and Huma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity are ſo united and ioyned togeather, that they make but one Perſonne, which is true God, and true Man; whom the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles ſignify by theſe names, IESUS-CHRIST, SON OF GOD, and OUR LORD.</p>
            <p n="2">2. Firſt they call him IESUS, which ſignifys a Saviour; And it was impoſed with great reaſon. For if Joſeph in the Egiptian tongue was Called Saviour, becauſe he kept the people from <note place="margin">
                  <hi>Gen.</hi> 41. <hi>Numb.</hi> 13.</note> famine by his providence; if Oſee the Son of Num the Succeſſor of Moyſes had the ſame name, becaus he led the people into the land of Promiſe after they had fought many battells; And if the Son of Ioſadech had alſo the ſame name, for contribu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting <note place="margin">1. <hi>Eſdras.</hi> 3.</note> to the delivery of the people out of the captivity of Babylon; with much more reaſon our Saviour received this name, ſince He does not only deliver ſome particular people out of certain cala<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mities as they did: but moreover all mankind from ſin, damna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and eternal miſery.</p>
            <p n="3">3. He alſo apply's himſelf to our Salvation with ſo much ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derneſs and affection, with ſo much fervour and zeal, that more than moſt deſervingly He may take from this alſo his Name. They that love paſſionatly write in a ring with their own name, that of their beloved, The Son of God hath written our ſalvation, not with his Name, but in his Name: He cannot thinke of his own Name without remembring our Salvation. When you will expreſs an ardent deſire of any thing, you ſay, I would give for it a part of my blood: IESUS ſayd it not: but He hath don it: and He gave, not a part only, but all his precious Blood for our Salvation.</p>
            <p>IESUS makes ſo much account of our ſoules, that having bought them with his Blood, He pleaſes himſelf in the bargaine: and shal we ſell them to the Devill, for a little money, or for a brutal pleaſure? He begins to ſuffer for us from the time He begins to live: and shal we ſerve him,
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:108789:16"/> but when we decay, or begin to die? He thinks not on his Name, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out remembring us: and shal we hear or pronounce this holy Name without calling to minde the benefit of our Redemption: without thanking and honouring the Perſonne named? Let us have him in our thoughts frequently in the day, thanking him, and offering our ſelves to him; In our words ſpeaking often of him, and of what He hath done to be our IESUS; In our prayers, demanding of him, and by him, the graces and vertues which are neceſſary for us; In our hearts, loving him, and reioycing in him.</p>
            <p n="4">4. In the ſecond place, the Apoſtles call him CHRIST, which ſignifys annointed; And this name was given to Prieſts, Kings, <note place="margin">
                  <hi>Exod.</hi> 29 1. <hi>kings.</hi> 10. 3. <hi>kings.</hi> 19</note> and Prophets: becauſe they were annointed with oyle (which ſigni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fys grace) in figure of IESUS CHRIST; But IESUS is not a Prieſt only: but the ſovereign Prieſt of Prieſtes: not King only: but the King of Kings: not Prophet only: but Prophet of all the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets; Prieſt, King, Prophet; Annointed, not by men, but by God: not with oyle, but with the fullneſs of his graces,</p>
            <p n="5">5. In the third place, they call him Son of the Omnipo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent Father; SON, not by adoption or grace only, but by nature; For He is begotten from all eternity, not according to his hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manity, or according to his Soul and Body, but according to his divine Perſon: Begotten I ſay, not carnally, corporeally; but ſpiritually, divinely, and incomprehenſibly, by the underſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding of the Father, or by the knowledg the eternal Father hath of himſelf. And by the property of his birth. He receives three names, which are to him particular, notional, and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonal: which appertaine to him, and not to the other Perſons of the BB. Trinity. He is a WORD, an JMAGE, a SON. He is a WORD, <hi>Verbum erat apud Deum,</hi> the WORD was with God. <note place="margin">

He is a WORD; becauſe produced by the Vnderſtanding; a WORD: for the ſcience, knowledge and doctrine of the Father is moſt ſimple and uncompounded; 'tis but one only WORD, but which repreſents all, ſays all, and does all. He is an Image: for He is the actual knowledg which God hath
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:108789:17"/> of himſelf, the Expreſſion of his Eſſence: He repreſents it then perfectly, otherwiſe the Science of God would be imperfect; He is then the natural image, lively repreſentation, and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect character of Gods ſubſtance. He is a SON: for He is produced by the Vnderſtanding, by a natural Power, by a natural and vital action, and through inclination the Eternal Father hath to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce his like, not only by reſemblance, but in identity of Nature. He is then the true Son of God, his production is true genera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and He is not only equal to the Father, but the ſame God with him.</p>
            <p n="6">6. They Say, <hi>only Son.</hi> And He is ſo the only one, that 'tis impoſſible there should be another; becauſe the eternal Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther begets him moſt neceſſarily and continually: and his gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rative Power tho' infinite, is wholy, entirely; and eternally em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployd in producing him.</p>
            <p n="7">7, In fine the Apoſtles moſt juſtly call him <hi>Our Lord.</hi> For ſo He is by many Titles. Other Lords and Sovereigns have generally but one Title, one only right to their Dominions, and that ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>metimes pretended, uſurped, and uniuſtly acquired, or at the beſt a very ſlight one. JESUS is our <hi>Lord</hi> by all ſorts of Rights, by all the Titles that can give authority and juriſdiction. He is our <hi>Lord</hi> becauſe He created us; the Workman is naturally Maſter of his worke 'the Father of his child, and the Potter of his earthen veſſel; He is our <hi>Lord,</hi> becauſe He conſerves, nourishes and hinders us from returning to the nothing, out of which He drew us; He is our <hi>Lord,</hi> becauſe He directs, governs and commands us, and by other prerogatives of Nature.</p>
            <p n="8">8.

JESUS hath much more reaſon to make the like plea to us, and to oblige us to his ſervice: for he hath fought in his own perſon for us: He hath been wounded in the combat: He hath delivered us from the deplorable ſervitude of Sin, freed us from the moſt cruel tyranny of Satan, and drawn us from his oppreſſion; are we not then his ſlaves?

            <p>What ſervice do they render him?

Trinity;</hi> That, that which ariſes by this Vnion is perfect God and perfect man; That He was ſuch in a womans wombe; That she remaining a Virgin, was a Mother: Mother of a <hi>Man-God:</hi> Morher of God and Mother of Man: theſe, I ſay, are things which ſurpaſs Nature: and are the ſubjects of our admira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. I admire not ſayd S. Cyprian, the ſtabylity of the earth which ſtands by its own weight in the midſt of the Vnivers; I admire not the volubility of the firmament, which moves day and night and hath no Center in which it may end its motion; I admire not the inconſtancie of the Moon, which never remains in the ſame ſtate, but increaſes, or decreaſes every moment; I admire not the Sun which shews it ſelf always full, which is infatigable in its cours, and marches as a Gyant to communicate its light and heat to all the quarters of the world; But I admire God made man, I admire a God in the womb of a Virgin: I admire the Omnipotent an impotent infant: And we may add, I admire the <hi>Creator</hi> made a Creature: the <hi>Lord</hi> and <hi>Soverign,</hi> a ſubject, and a ſlave: and the <hi>Iudg,</hi> a criminal in appearance. In all the other wonders of nature, I finde ſome reaſons that do ſatisfy me; But in this Miſtery I have nothing els, but that which the prophet <hi>Abacuc</hi> did ſay, <hi>I have conſidered your works, and am aſtoniſhed.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="2">2. <hi>Born of the Virgin Marie.</hi> This is the ſecond Birth of the Son of God; In his firſt, He iſſued forth of the Vnderſtanding of the Father from all eternity; In this He came forth of his mothers womb in time. The eternal birth is admirable: the temporal is amiable; I honor and reverence the eternal; I em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brace and love the temporal; I rejoyce in that<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and I enjoy this; I glorify God for the firſt: and I thanke him for the ſecond; the eternal created me, and the temporal repaired me; It would have nothing profited me to have been created, if I had not been redeemed; by IESUS begotten of the Father I was created; by IESUS born of the Virgin I was redeemed; I have then more obligation to IESUS born of the Virgin, than
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:108789:19"/> to IESUS begotten of the Father; And I find many marvells in this ſecond birth, as well as in the firſt. I will explicate the marvells of theſe his births, and of his Conception, by a compariſon ſo proper and ſo natural, ſo clear and ſo intelligi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, that the moſt indocible may come by it to a competent knowledg of theſe miſteries.</p>
            <p n="3">3. Amongſt all the creatures purely corporal, there is not one that expreſſes God ſo naturally as the Sun. You ſee the Sun produces a Ray, which is its offſpring; There is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing more viſible than the Sun producing its Ray: nothing alſo is more clear, bright, and viſible than the Ray; and nevertheleſs there is nothing that we have ſo much difficulty to eye: we cannot fix our eyes upon it: not through want of light; but through exceſſive clearneſs, and through the weakneſs of our ſight; So the Son of God is begotten by his Father in the light of his Divinity, by the way of underſtanding and of know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledg; there is nothing then more intelligible than this Generation: and nevertheleſs there is nothing that we are ſo unable to under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand: 'tis darkneſs to us, by reaſon of the weakneſs of our underſtanding</p>
            <p>Thô the Ray be the offſpring of the Sun: it is nevertheleſs as ancient as the Sun: and if the ſun had been from all Eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity, its Ray would have alſo been eternal; So though IESUS CHRIST according to his Divinity be the Son of God thc Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther: He is nevertheleſs as ancient as his Father: He is from all Eternity, even as his Father.</p>
            <p>The Sun by its Ray warms the air, makes the earth fruitful and produces gold and ſilver, metalls and mineralls in the heart of it; So the eternal Father by his Son Created Heaven and earth, men <note place="margin">

                  <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

            </p>
            <p>The Sun loſes nothing by giving Being to its Ray: on the contrary, the ray is the glory, beauty, and ornament of the Sun; So the Son of God is the ſplendor of the Father, and the figure of his ſubſtance: 'tis the Father's great perfection to begett a Son, who is God as He, and the ſame God with him.</p>
            <p>The Ray coms forth of the Sun, and is ſent down to us: but it coms forth of it, without comming from it: you ſee it in the Sun, thô it be upon the earth; So when faith teaches
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:108789:20"/> us, that the Son of God deſcended from heaven, and came into this world, this is not to ſay he left the boſome of his Father: He always remain'd there thô He appeared here.</p>
            <p>The Sunbeam coms into this Church and paſſes through red glaſs How did it enter into it, how did it go out of ir? I know not; It went into it without opening it: it went out of it, without breaking it; ſo the Son of God came into this world, and paſſed through the bleſſed womb of the Virgin: How was He there conceiv'd? I know not; How was He brought forth? I know not; He was conceiv'd there: He was brought forth: without opening, without breaking, and without prejudicing the Virginal wombe.</p>
            <p>The ray paſſing through the glaſs beautifies it, renders it more clear and reſplendent; So JESUS paſſing through the womb of Mary, rendred her Virginity more pure, more holy, and more ſacred: <hi>Matris integritatem non minuit, ſed ſacravit.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>What hath the Ray don in this glaſs? it hath borrowed a little redneſs; it is becom coloured, the glaſs hath cloathed it with a red colour; And what did JESUS in the womb of Mary? He borrowed humane nature, which is made if a little red earth, Adam, that is to ſay, red earth: He made himſelf man there, the Virgin cloathed him with our humanity.</p>
            <p>The ray borrowing of the glaſs this red colour, deprived not the glaſs of it; JESUS borrowing of Mary our humane nature, did not any hurt or prejudice to Mary.</p>
            <p>The ſunbeam before it entred into the glaſs, was a Ray, but it was not colour, nor coloured: But ſince 'tis entred into this glaſs, and is com into this Church, 'tis a coloured Ray, 'tis a radiant colour, 'tis a colour which is a Ray; So IESUS before the incarnation was God from all eternity: But He was not man: Now ſince He is entred into Mary, He is a humaniſed God, He is a Deified man; is a God who is man, and a man that is God.</p>
            <p>The ſupport and the ſubſiſtance of this red colour that appears here, is the Ray; for this colour ſubſiſts not, but by this Ray; So what is the ſupport and the ſubſiſtance of the holy Humanity; Tis the Son of God, it hath no ſubſiſtance beſydes him.</p>
            <p>This Sunbeam as a Ray or light of the Sun, is in all the
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:108789:20"/> world: But as a coloured Ray, it is not every where, it is only here and in ſome other places; IESUS as God, and Son of God, is in every place; But as man He is not every where: He is but in Heaven, and in the holy SACRAMENT.</p>
            <p>Who is the Father of this coloured Ray? 'Tis the Sun; But the Sun produced not the colour: But it produced the Ray which is joyned with the colour; and who is the mother of this coloured Ray? 'tis the glaſs, but it made not the ray but it produced the radiant colour: it cloathed the ray with this Robe of colour; Who is the Father of IESUS MAN-GOD? It is the eternal Father: He begot not of his ſubſtance the Humanity of JESUS; But He begot of his Subſtance the Perſon of his Son, who is Man; Who is the Mother of this MAN-GOD? It is Mary; she begot not the Divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity: But she conceived the Man who is God: the cloathed the Perſon of the Son of God with our humanity<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
            </p>
            <p>Which is the more ancient, this coloured Ray, or the glaſs? The Ray, as a Ray, as the offſpring of the Sun, is a long time before the glaſs, it is from the beginning of the world, it is as ancient as the Sun: But the Ray as coloured is younger than the Sun; Who is the more ancient IESUS or Mary? IESUS as God, or as Son of God, is long before Mary, He is from eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity, as the Father and the holy Ghoſt: But JESUS as man, is younger than his Mother.</p>
            <p>This Ray being in the ſun is ſo bright and reſplendent that i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> dazells the eyes of them that look upon it; but the ſame ray being deſcended here below, and cloathed with a red colour is eaſily beheld; ſo the ſon of God in the boſome of his Father, is inviſible, ineffable, inacceſſible, and incomprehenſible; But the ſame Son of God, being cloathed with our humanity, is made viſible, palpable, and ſenſible: to the end He might illuminate and inſtruct us, that He might be the Director of ſouls, and the Doctor of juſtice, as He is called by the Prophets; And He begins betimes to perform the charge: He exercices the office from the beginning of his life.</p>
            <p n="4">4. This inſant newly born does preach: his pulpit is the cra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle: his Auditory the univers: his Doctrine is the contempt of the world; He preaches, not by word: for He cannot ſpeak:
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:108789:21"/> but by example; He preaches not to the eares: But to the eyes: He ſays, that voluntary poverty is better than riches; And the world on the contrary ſays, that money is to be pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cured in the firſt place: that a man muſt have it, tho' he hazard his ſoul for it.</p>
            <p>This divine infant ſays, the humble, ſimple, innocent, and mortifyd life is that which pleaſes God.</p>
            <p>The World ſays, a man muſt greaten himſelf, appear glorious, Machevalize ſubtily, Circumvent and diceive craftily<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and live in delights and pleaſures.</p>
            <p n="5">5. Behold two Maſters quite contrary, two doctrines diametri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cally oppoſite! It is neceſſary the one, or the other be decei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>v'd. To ſay this infant is deceiv'd, is horrible blaſphemy; He is the eternal Wiſdom, the increated Wiſdom, the Angel of the great Council. It muſt then be confeſt, that the Avaricious, Ambi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, Voluptuous, and Machiavilians are groſſly deceived.</p>
            <p n="6">6.

            <p n="7">7. What shal I ſay of the punishments receiv'd in his ſacred Body? He ſuffered more horrible, harsh, and bitter torments than were ever ſuffer'd by any creature upon earth. The Prophet Iſaiah calls him by excellence <hi>the man of Paines.</hi> Abel was mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thered, <note place="margin">
                  <hi>c.</hi> 33. 3.</note> Zachary was ſtoned, Iſaiah ſawed, Lazarus covered with ulcers, and not one of them is called <hi>the man of Paines.</hi> We have heard of men, to whom their vertues or their vices, their birth or their condition, have given honourable or shamefull Names; But we have not heard but of IESUS-CHRIST only to whom Paine hath given a name; He is the Man of Pains, becauſe He did bear all our paines; He is the man of Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ines, becaus He ſuffered in all his members; and He is the man of Pains, becaus He was pierced through with Pains, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed, Sacrificed, and given wholy over to ſufferances and Pains.</p>
            <p n="8">8. But the ſufferances in his ſoul will make appear yet better the Greatneſs of his Paine. He ſayd in the Garden, <hi>my ſoul is ſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rowfull to death:</hi> It would ſeperate my ſoul and Body, if I shoul not hinder it, for to endure yet more.</p>
            <p>To whatſoever part He caſts his ſight, He ſees objects of the greateſt ſorrow: His ſoul is nail'd to a moſt hard Croſs, before his Body is Crucifyd; and the Croſs of his Soul is much more harsh, and inſupportable, then that of his Body. The three nails of this interiour croſs are the injuries don to
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:108789:23"/> his Father: the Commpaſſion of his Mother: and the damna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of his brothers.</p>
            <p>Philoſophy teaches us that a paine is more sharp and bitter, when 'tis received in a power more pure and immaterial. IESUS was pierced, with paine not only in the inferior part of his ſoul, but alſo in the ſuperior, which is wholy ſpiritual, in the part in which He was bleſſed: and his Beatitude alſo contri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buted to the increas of paine, ſays S. Laurence Juſtinian. He <note place="margin">de tryum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phali Chriſti Agone.</note> saw by the light of glory God face to face: He knew clearly the Greatneſs of his Majeſty: the outrage and the injury that ſin does him: he loved him with a moſt ardent and exceſſive love: and therefore He could not be but exceſſively afflicted ſeeing the Ocean of ſins committed againſt that moſt high, adorable and amiable Majeſty; The wounds of his Body were made by hands of Torterers: hands indeed moſt cruell and inhumane: Yet their activity had ſtil limits; But the wounds of his heart were inflicted by the hand of love, by the love which He had for his Father: a love ineffable and incomprehenſible; If a ſoule that loved God well, could have as much contrition as she would deſire; ô how would she pierce herſelf with ſorow<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> How wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lingly would she bathe herſelf in her tears! ô how would she calcinate her poor heart! JESUS had as much of ſorrow as He deſired, and He deſired as much of it as He had love for his Father: his ſorrow was equal with his love; If He had ſeen but one only mortal ſin committed againſt him whom He ſo loved, He would have grieved infinitely; ô how then was He afflicted when He ſaw ſo many, ſo different, and ſo enormous!</p>
            <p n="9">9. The love which he had for his Mother, was another nail that pierced his heart, and which faſtned him to this interior Croſs. He ſees her preſent at all the Miſteries of his bitter Paſſion; He ſees all the wonds of his Body united in her heart: and we may ſay that his <hi>compaſſion</hi> was another <hi>Paſſion.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="10">10. He looks below: <hi>His ſoul is ſorrowfull:</hi> He ſees the torments of hell, wherein ſo many shal be plunged notwithſtanding his ſufferances for them. He ſees that their wounds are incurable, that they abuse his Blood, death, and merits, and that after ſo many remedies they damne themſelves for trifles, and
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:108789:23"/> what He indured for them, would ſerve but as oyle and ſulphur to inflame the divine Juſtice to punish their ingratitude more rigo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rouſly.</p>
            <p n="11">11. S. Auſtin wholy aſtonished at the ſight of CHRISTS ſufferance cry's out: ô Son of God? whither hath your humi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity deſcended! whither hath your charity been inflamed! whi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther hath your piety extended it ſelf! The Wiſeman ſayd, that you have don every thing <hi>in number, weight, and meaſure,</hi> But in this work of your Love, You have obſerv'd neither num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber, nor weight, nor meaſure; You have exceeded all hopes and deſires; You have made an exceſs that could not be imagined; The Angells were aſtonished conſidering this wonder: a God whipt! a God cover'd with ſpittle! the King of kings crown'd with thorns! a God crucifyed for ſlaves! a God pierced with ſorrows for worms of the earth, of whom He had no need, and knowing, that they would be ungratfull for ſo great a Bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit. What tranſport! what exceſs! and if He were not God, I might ſay with Pagans, what folly of Love! <hi>Gentibus ſtultitia.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="12">12. After a love ſo cordial, undeſerv'd, and ſo exceſſive, shal we not love him? If the leaſt ſlave had don the ſame for us, He would be Maſter of our hearts; and ſeeing a God hath don it, shal He not be? <hi>Qui non diligit Dominum Ieſum Anathema ſit,</hi> 
               <note place="margin">1. <hi>cor.</hi> 16. 22.</note> ſays S. Paul: ſince JESUS ſuffer'd for us, if any one love him not, let him be Anathema, Curs'd, excommunicated, and abhorred of all creatures. But if any one should not love him, and moreover be ſo ungratfull as to offend him, what punishment would You wish him holy Apoſtle. He adds it not; nor can one wish him a pain ſo great as he deſerves; there should be a new hell to revenge an ingratitude ſo monſtrous and enormous.</p>
            <p n="13">13. For as S. Bernard ſayd, if Moſes ſpeaking to the Iews, who had but a groſs and imperfect Law. who had not been redeem'd by IESUS-CHRIST, ſayd to them <hi>Thou ſhalt love the Lord thy God, with all thy heart, with all thy foul, and with all thy forces;</hi> what ought Chriſtians to do after the Incarnation, Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demption, and Paſſion of our Saviour? Ought they not to burn with love? ſhould they not, if it were poſſible, love JESUS
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:108789:24"/> above all their forces, thoughts, and activity of their hearts? If I owe my ſelf wholy to him for making me, what ſhal I add now for repairing me, and repairing me in ſuch a manner?</p>
            <p n="14">14. Let us love him then, ſince He ſo loved us; let's not love him only in words and compliments; let us not content our ſelves to ſay, I honour much my <hi>Saviour,</hi> I love him with all my heart: But let us love him in worke and Verity: in doing, in giving, and in ſuffering for him: for ſo He loved us; And ſince his goodneſs is ſo infinite, and his love to us ſo exceſſive, that He preferred us, not only before Angells, but alſo before him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf: it would be a horrible blindeneſs to preferr any other good before him; it would be a ſtrange folly to offend him, to diſoblige his goodneſs, to loſe his amity and his favour, for honour, pleaſure, profit, or ſatisfaction of a Paſſion. Do not ſo if you be wiſe: Say rather with S. Auſtin, all abundance, all honour, all felicity, that is not you my God, is but poverty, vanity, and miſery; ſay as S. Francis did, <hi>my God You are my All!</hi> Love him with all your heart, ſince He his all your good: love him with a ſovereign love, ſince He is ſovereignly good: love, adore, bleſs, prayſe, glorify him now, and ever. Amen.</p>

            <p>This world <hi>Hell</hi> ſignify's an inferiour and low place; And therefore the holy Church makes uſe of it in divers occaſions, to ſignify
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:108789:24"/> divers inferiour places. By this word she moſt often underſtands the place of everlaſting damnation; And ſo our Saviour called it in <note place="margin">1. <hi>Luke.</hi> 36.</note> 
               <hi>S.</hi> Luk. where ſpeaking of the unfortunate rich man ſays, <hi>he was buried in hell.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Other times she uſes this terme to ſignify Purgatory: where they are, who died in the grace of God, but having not fully ſatiſfyed the divine Iuſtice, are further to be punished; ſo in the Maſs of the dead she prayes. <hi>free ô Lord the ſouls of the faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full departed, from the paines of hell.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>She makes uſe of it alſo to ſignify the place, whither the ſouls of holy and juſt perſons who were not ſubject to purgation, or had duely ſatiſfyd for their offences went, before the death of the Saviour of the world: expecting He should open them the gates of Heaven by his Paſſion.</p>
            <p n="2">2. <hi>He deſcended,</hi> not only by effect into theſe two laſt places making his power and goodneſs to appear by delivering the ſoules in them detained: But in ſubſtance He deſcended into them: his ſoul was really in thoſe places, and He honoured the ſoules that were in them, and made them happy by his preſence</p>
            <p>
               <hi>The third day he roſe again from the dead;</hi> He roſe no ſooner, for to teſtify that He was truly dead, and to fulfill the figure of <note place="margin">
                  <hi>Matt.</hi> 12. 40.</note> him; <hi>As Ionas was three days and three nights in the belly of a whale ſo ſhal be the Son of man in the bowells of the earth.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>He would be three days ſubject to the law of death, to teach us myſtically that by his death and Paſſion, He had ſatisfyd the three Perſons of the B. Trinity, for the ſins committed in the three ſtates of the world: in the Law of nature, in the Law of Moſes, and in the Law of grace: And to shew us that his Paſſion was the cauſe of the delivery of the ancient Fathers out of hell, of the Redemption of men on earth: and of the reparation of the Angelical thrones in Heaven.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>He roſe again:</hi> By which words the Apoſtles teach us, that He <note place="margin">
                  <hi>S. Iohn.</hi> 10.</note> return'd to life by his own power; He ſayd alſo in the Goſpell, <hi>I have power to lay down my life, and to take it up againe;</hi> and in another place, <hi>I will raiſe up my Body in three daies after death</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="3">3. I know well, that S. Peter and S. Paul teach in many places, that his Father raiſed Him up to life; becauſe this mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racle <note place="margin">S. Pater</note>
               <pb n="40" facs="tcp:108789:25"/> is an eff<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

Trinity, yet is attributed commonly to the Father. 'Tis true then that He roſe up by his own Power; and 'tis true alſo, that the eternal Father raiſed him: to the end He might shew his goodneſs both ro him and us.</p>
            <p n="4">4. Firſt to him: that his Body might receive the Glory which He merited by his labors, humiliations, and ſufferances; <hi>For He humhled himſelf</hi> ſays the Apoſtle <hi>being obedient unto death: for the which thing God hath exalted him;</hi> Note <hi>exalted him:</hi> for his Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurrection was not a ſimple return from death to life: but an entrance into a glorious life; That Body which He layd down paſſible and mortall, He receives impaſſible and immortal: that which was inglorious, now is glorious: which was infirm, now is powerfull: which was a natural Body now is becom a ſpiritual. Theſe are the excellent qualities which S. Paul attributes to every <note place="margin">1. <hi>cor.</hi> 15. <hi>matt.</hi> 13 43.</note> glorifyd Body; But that of Glory or clarity delights me moſt; for the body of every ſaint shal shine by it, as the ſun: <hi>fulgebunt juſti ſicut ſol;</hi> and nevertheleſs one shal differ from another in this Quality, as much as he exceeded him here in good works, or as <hi>S.</hi> Paul ſays, <hi>as one ſtarr differs in glory from another.</hi> What glory then, what admirable ſplendor, what ravishing beauty was given to the adorable Body of JSUS in recompence of his merits? And what ſatisfaction, and felicity will it be to ſee it, when our eyes shal be able to behold it, as hereafter they shall be by their impaſſibility?</p>
            <p>Theſe four qualities belong to the Body of the Son of God, as a body glorifyd; But as a Body Deifyd, as ſubſiſting in the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinity, it hath yet a farr other Glory: Jt hath a ſupereminent, ineffable, and incomprehenſible Glory, as we may ſee in the next Diſcours.</p>
            <p n="5">5. Wherfore the Son of God thanks his Father for that He brought his ſoul out of hell, and his Body out of the ſepulcher, and that He raiſed him up again, <hi>Exaltabo te Domine quoniam ſuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepiſti</hi>

               <hi>me. Eduxisti ab inferno animam meam.</hi> And He eſteems ſo much this favour, that He exhorts us to thanke God, to praiſe and glorify him for it, <hi>Pſallite Domino fancti ejus, &amp; confitemini memoriae ſanctificationis ejus.</hi> 
               <note place="margin">

            <p n="6">
               <pb n="41" facs="tcp:108789:25"/> 6. This is that which many never did, that of which many never thought. Our devotions are often but productions of ſelf love, practiſes of intereſt, and reflections vpon our ſelves. If we pray God, we demand not of him but that which concerns our ſpiritual or temporal profit. If we thanke him, 'tis but for the good which He hath don us, or thoſe of our family: this is to love our ſelves, and our ſalvation; this is good, but not perfect. If we are perfect Chriſtians, and loving Diſciples of IESUS: we will love him more than our own ſelves, be concern'd in his intereſts, and pray God his Father for the exaltation of his glory, and the accomplishment of his deſignes: We will thank Him often, that He revived his Son, and reſtored Him the life which our ſins had taken from him, that He elevated him, and placed him at his right hand.</p>
            <p n="7">7. Secondly, God shews in this Miſtery his Goodneſs alſo to us; for as his Son was incarnated for us, as He liv'd and died for us, ſo He is raiſed to life again for us; We are quickned with him, are raiſed-up with him, and his Reſurrection is an aſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance and pledg of ours. <hi>If there be no reſurrection of the dead, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther</hi>

               <hi>Chriſt is riſen again,</hi> ſays S. Paul; <hi>But now Chriſt is riſen again from the dead the first fruits of them that ſleep; by a man death, and by a man the Reſurrection of the dead; and as in Adam all die, ſo alſo in Chriſt all shal be made alive. We ſhal all indeed riſe again,</hi> ſays the ſame Apoſtle: <hi>But we ſhal not all be changed:</hi> to witt into a better, and more glorious ſtate. But only ſuch as conform them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves to IESUS-CHRIST, who is their Rule, mirour, and modell.</p>
            <p n="8">8. He contributed much to his glorious Reſurrection, He merited it, and dispos'd himſelf to it, by his ſufferances, humiliations, patience, and other moſt perfect and heroical acts of vertues which He practiſed. He by dying, taught us to dye to ſin: by riſing again, to riſe to a new life, and by dying no more, to live, profit, and perſever to the end in ſanctity and holineſs, as his Apoſtle declares and urges much in his epiſtle to the Romans. <note place="margin">

            </p>
            <p n="9">9. Let not then men deceive themſelves; Let them not think to be glorifyd in Heaven, if they be not Sanctify'd on earth; Let them not think to enter into a glorious life any other way
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:108789:26"/> then that of ſufferances, of mortifications, and Chriſtian vertues; This is the only way which the Son of God preſcrib'd: which our Saviour beate, and which the ſaints have followed. Hear S. Paul and S. Bernahas <hi>By many tribulations we muſt enter into the kingdom</hi> 
               <note place="margin">
                  <hi>Acts.</hi> 14. 21.</note> 
               <hi>of God;</hi> they ſay not, that 'tis a ſalutary Counſel: 'tis a more aſſured way: But, <hi>we muſt,</hi> that 'tis neceſſary to paſs, not through two or three; but through many ſuffetances to com to the kingdom of God. There is nothing more clear, more firm and certain then the words of the ſon of God, who ſays, <hi>He</hi> 
               <note place="margin">
                  <hi>S. Luke</hi> 9. 23.</note> 
               <hi>that will com after me, Let him renounce himſelf, and carry his croſs daily, and follow me.</hi> Now in good earneſt, will they dare to ſay, that living as they do in the world: hanting almoſt continually balls, commedies, places of lewdeneſs, banquets, other pleaſures and paſtimes, is to renounce one ſelf, and to carry daily the croſs, and to follow Chriſt?</p>
            <p>He tels his Diſciples in the day of his Reſurrection, what way <note place="margin">
                  <hi>S. Luke.</hi> C. 24.</note> He went; <hi>Ought not Chriſt to have ſuffered theſe things, and ſo to enter into his glory?</hi> Note <hi>ought;</hi> It was neceſſary that Chriſt should ſuffer, and that He should enter by this means into his glory, into the glory which was his own, to which He had ſo much right: and will they think without ſuffering any thing to tame their paſſions, and without mortifying themſelves, to enter into the glory, to which they have no right, into the glory which they have ſo often demerited, and which they have renounced by ſo many Crimes?</p>
            <p>We cannot have this glory but in quality of the heires of God, and coheirs of <hi>Ieſus Chriſt:</hi> and his Apoſtle declares, that to obtain this favour, we muſt ſuffer with <hi>Ieſus Christ.</hi>

                  <hi>Apor.</hi> 7. 14.</note> in the Apocalips ſeeing the aſſembly of them, one ſayd to him, that they came out of great tribulation: they are happily arrived: they tooke then a good way: and we if wiſe, will follow the ſame, and leave the other way.</p>
            <p n="10">10. We ſee in the Church two different ways, two different lives of thoſe that have any deſire to ſave themſelves; one is of thoſe who
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:108789:26"/> lead a holy life, mortifyd, devout, perfect, and fervent in good works; The other is of them that lead a life, not in the ſight of men Criminal: but ſlack, negligent, and imperfect; they com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit not great Crimes: but they do not alſo much good: and withall they will that ſelflove be always ſatisfyd; they treat themſelves well: they paſs their time in ſports, walks, ſuperfluous viſits, and other divertiſments, which they terme innocent: they do no injury to any: but they concern not themſelves in the ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſities of their neighbours. All without exception approve and commend the firſt way; not one, or very few will have the bold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs to warrant the ſecond way; this way then at leaſt is uncertaine, fallible, and dangerous. And S. Auguſtin ſays, when <note place="margin">
                  <hi>Lib.</hi> 1. <hi>de Bapt.</hi> C. 3.</note> the ſalvation of our ſoules is concern'd, we fail againſt the love we owe to our ſelves, if we take not the ſureſt way. 'Tis a ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>xime of the Law, that we muſt not leave the certaine for the uncertaine; and that we muſt uſe the more precaution, where there is more danger; Common ſenſe and experience shew, that by how much a loſs is greater, we apprehend the danger of it with more fear: by how much an evill is more terrible, we avoyd the peril of it with more care. Does it not ſeem to you a great loſs to loſe the kingdom of heaven, the poſſeſſion and the enioyance of a God? And is it not a great evill to be burnt a live? to be always burning and not conſuming? 'Tis an infinite loſs, an infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nite evill. We muſt then avoyd, I will not ſay the danger, but the appearance of danger; for we cannot have too much aſſurance in a matter of ſo great importance. I pray our Lord to give us grace to live ſo holily, that we may be found worthy of this im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mortall Reſurrection, and of the happy Eternity. Amen.</p>

He tryumphed not only over enemies of flesh and blood, but alſo over devills, ſin, and death. The ſpoils He carried with him, were not flocks of sheep and troops of other beaſts, but innumerable multitudes of ſouls, which He redeem'd out of Priſon, and reſcued out of the jawes of Hell: <hi>Thou art aſcended high, thou haſt taken Captivity,</hi> ſays the Rayal Prophet to him. <note place="margin">

               <pb n="45" facs="tcp:108789:27"/> part; How does He ſit then at his right hand? And if He ſits in a ſeat or Throne: of what matter is it made? is it of wood, marble, gold, ſilver, or Diamant? I know well 'tis anſwered, the Apoſtles accommodate themſelves to our low manner of underſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding and of ſpeaking, and that by this ſeſſion at the right hand of the Father, they expreſs the equality and conſubſtantiality of the Father and the Son. When we ſee one ſpeak to the king on knee, we conclude he is a Vaſſall; But if we ſee one ſit upon a throne neer the king, and at his right hand, we ſay he is a Prince or Sovereign. The Apoſtles ſay, JESUS <hi>ſits at the right hand of the Father:</hi> this is to ſay, He is Sovereign, Omnipotent and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finite as the Father, equal, coeſſential, and coeternal with the Father.</p>
            <p n="4">4. Yes: But JESUS as man, is not conſubſtantial, nor coe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal with the Father, and yet He is at the right hand of the Father, not only as God, but alſo as man, as S. Leo expreſly teaches in his firſt ſermon of the Aſcenſion.</p>
            <p>You will ſay, the humane nature of JESUS is in the Throne of God, and at the right hand of the Father, becaus being as it were ingraffted, and inſerted in the Being of God, in the ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtance of the <hi>Word,</hi> and making but one Perſon with him, 'tis ſerved and reverenced as God.</p>
            <p n="5">5. You ſay true, but this ſolues not the difficulty; For this holy Humanity is united to the Word, and ſubſiſting in his Perſona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity from the firſt inſtant of Chriſts Conception: and nevertheleſs, to ſpeak properly: it is not but ſince the day of his Aſcenſion, that the Humanity is elevated to the glory of the Father, and ſeated at his right hand, as the church ſays in the Canon of the Maſs that day.</p>
            <p n="6">6. For to clear then theſe difficulties, we muſt remember, that in the Miſtery of the incarnation, the Son of God communicating his ſubſiſtance to the holy Humanity, should have made it at the ſame time participant of all the perfections and Attributes, of which a created Nature may be capable; For if in a perfect marriage, the Woman eſpouſes not only the Perſon of her husband, but alſo his nobility, prerogatives, and Honours: shal not the ſacred Humanity which is married much more perfectly and inſeparebly
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:108789:28"/> to the <hi>Word,</hi> receive from him the Perfections that are commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicable to It? A Vegetative ſoul penetrating the ſtock of a little tree makes it live with a Vegetative life. A ſenſitive ſoul infor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming the body of a Lamb, makes it live with a ſenſitive life: An intellectual ſoul animating the body of a man, makes it live with a reaſonable life: and the divine <hi>Word</hi> actuating, filling, and poſſeſſing the holy Humanity shal He not make it live with a divine life? Ought He not to communicate to it his proprieties and his Attributes? ſince He is united to it more ſtrictly, per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectly, and nobly, than any soul is to her Body, or form to its matter?</p>
            <p n="7">7. Nevettheleſs the divine <hi>Word</hi> to procure our ſalvation, and to accomplish the work of our Redempion, ſuspended in his Incarnation the communication of divers of his perfections. For if JESUS had been immortall, how should he have dyed for us? If He had been impaſſible, how would He have ſuffered for us? If He had been independent and ſovereign, how would have he given us an example of obedience, ſubjecting himſelf to his holy Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther? But in the day of his Aſcenſion He made an entire effuſion of himſelf, and of all his excellencies, and perfections, that were communicable to Humanity.</p>
            <p n="8">8<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> This is that which He asked of his Father in the Vigil of his death, when He ſayd, <hi>Now glorify me o Father with thy ſelf, with the glory which I had with thee, before all ages.</hi> Vpon which <note place="margin">
                  <hi>S. Iohn.</hi> 17. 5. <hi>Lib..</hi> 11. <hi>in Io.</hi> C. 17. <hi>Colloſs.</hi> 2. 9.</note> S. Cyrill of Alexandria ſays, <hi>The Saviour aſks to be glorifyd, not with an accidental glory but with a natural glory;</hi> and a little after, <hi>The glory which He always had as God, He asks now as man.</hi> This is moreover that which S. Paul teaches us, when he ſays, <hi>the ple<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitude or fullneſs of the Divinity inhabits corporally, in him,</hi> that is, <hi>in his Humanity,</hi> ſays the ſame S. Cyrill.</p>
            <p>And this is that wich ought to rejoyce us in this Miſtery: This is that which renders this Miſtery dear and precious to JESUS: to the Virgin: and to all the Church.</p>
            <p>'Tis in the Aſcenſion properly that JESUS Man God ſits at the right hand of the Omnipotent; 'tis in the Aſcenſion, that He was receiv'd into the Throne of God: and that He entred into the Glory of his Father.</p>
            <p n="9">
               <pb n="47" facs="tcp:108789:28"/> 9. <hi>He ſits,</hi> that is to ſay, He is no more ſubject to labours, tributary to wearines, lyable to humane miſeries and infirmities.</p>
            <p n="10">10. He is at the right hand of the Omnipotent; that is, He hath the ſuperintendence and the adminiſtration of Heaven and earth, of men and Angells, of ſpiritualls and temporalls. What ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nor, what happiness for us, to know and to be aſſured, that a perſone of the ſame nature with us hath the keyes of life and death, of Heaven and hell, that He governs all and does what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever He ſees good?</p>
            <p n="11">11. He is in the Throne of God: that is, He entred into the real, actual, and eternal enjoyance of his Empire.</p>
            <p n="12">12. He is in Glory of the Father; that is, He is received into a full, entire and perfect poſſeſſion of all the Grandeures of God that are agreable to his merits and to the quality of a man-God.</p>
            <p n="13">13. This Miſtery was moreover expedient for the holy Virgin. For if JESUS had remained amongſt us, until the end of the world, the Virgin all that time would have been deprived of part of her felicity; of the ſight of the adorable Body of her ſon, which is the moſt beautifull, charming, and raviſhing of all bodys. He ſayd then with good reaſon to the Virgin as well as to the reſt <hi>'Tis expedient for you that I go.</hi> 
               <note place="margin">
                  <hi>S. Iohn.</hi> 16. 7.</note>
            </p>
            <p n="14">14. But how did He ſay his Aſcenſion was expedient for us alſo? Was it expedient the Paſtor should be ſeperated from the sheep, the Head from the members, and the Eſpouſe from the ſpouſe?</p>
            <p>Nevertheleſs it was expedient for us; For He goes away, but leaves us not: He ſeparates from us, and dwells always amongſt us: He dwells not only amongſt us, but with us, but within us; had He remained amongſt us, He would not have entred into us: for He would not have inſtituted the Euchariſt which He left us for a ſupplement of his abſence.</p>
            <p>And tho' JESUS-CHRIST remaining on earth with us, would have inſtituted the holy Sacrement: Yet his Aſcenſion is very fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vourable to us; It is a ſubject of great conſolation and joy: be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caus it is a moſt certain Pledge, and an aſſured hope, that we may follow him; He ſayd to his Diſciples, <hi>I go to prepare a place for you.</hi> He left behynd him the print of his feet upon the moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain from whence He aſcended: and ſuffers not the place to be
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:108789:29"/> cover'd through which He paſſed, to teach us by theſe permanent miracles, that the way to Heaven is open and beaten for all the faithfull who will follow thither the tracts and footſteps which He left us.</p>
            <p n="15">15. But is not it a ſtrange thing that we cannot perſwade Chriſtians a verity ſo aſſured, and ſo important to their ſalvation, that to fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low him thither, they muſt neceſſarily imitate his actions. S. Peter, S. Paul, S. John Evangeliſt, the three moſt famous Apoſtles of the Son of God declare it to us. S. Peter, JESUS-CHRIST <note place="margin">
                  <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

               <hi>ſuffered for us, giving you exemple that you may follow his ſteps.</hi> S. Paul, <hi>whom God hath foreknown, He hath alſo predeſtinated to be made conformable to his Son.</hi> S. Iohn Evangeliſt, <hi>He that ſays that he abi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>des in</hi> JESUS-CHRIST, <hi>ought to walk as He hath walked.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The Son of God ſays <hi>if any one abide not in me he ſhal be caſt forth as a branch, and shal wither, and they shal gather him up and caſt him into the fire;</hi> to be ſaved then, and not to be caſt into hell fire, 'tis neceſſary to abide in CHRIST. Now his belo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved Diſciple ſays, that to abide in IESUS-CHRIST, we muſt walk as He walked, live as He lived, imitate the vertues which He practiſed, each one in his condition, and according to his capacity, by the aſſiſtance of his grace.</p>
            <p n="16">16. Let us then reſolve from this preſent hour to follow Him; The labor in practiſe of Vertue is but little: and the joy of it will be infinitely great; The pleaſure of this world which draws us from it is but short; the pain that attends it will be very long; the combate is very light: the Crown will be moſt ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent; this preſent life is short: and the future is eternal; of this short life depends an eternity of happineſs: which I pray God grant us all. Amen.</p>

            <p n="2">2 But ſome perhaps will ſay; If there be a particular Iudgment at the end of life, why shal there be a general in the end of the world? Is He who ſays of himſelf, <hi>I am meek and humble of heart:</hi> who was promiſed by the Prophets shew'd by the Precurſor under the figure of a Lamb ſo inclin'd to judg, that He is not ſatisfyd in judging once, but will judg again? The ſentence which He pronounces againſt us, or in favour of us in the hour of our death, is it not definitive and without appeal? or is there any thing in it to be reform'd that He will make reviſion of it in his general Aſſiſes?</p>
            <p n="3">3. To ſee cleary that 'tis more than moſt convenient that after the particular, there should be a general judgment in the face of
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:108789:30"/> the Vnivers; we need not but conſider the following reaſons.</p>

            <p>He was judged moſt unjuſtly, loden with reproches and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſions, dragg'd shamefully through the ſtreets of Hieruſalem, nail'd to an infamous croſs, He is daily contemn'd and mock'd by Infidells, Iews, Hereticks, and by bad Catholicks; Is it not reaſon that the world should make him honourable amends, and that He receive as much of Glory as He receiv'd of affronts and ignominies?</p>
            <p n="4">4. His Father himſelf does him ſo much honor<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> that He gives him not only authority to judg men, but takes him for judg in his own cauſe. The eternal Father ſays, He will aſſemble <note place="margin">

In the ſecond place, it is convenient there should be another Judgment beſides that which is made in the hour of our death: be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caus in this the ſoul is judged only, and the body ought to be judged alſo. For The body contributs much to the merit, and demerit of the ſoul: it cooperats vſually to the good, and to the evill which she practiſes; it is the cauſe that a reprobate ſoul offends God by intemperance, drunkenneſſe, luxury, idleneſs, vain orna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments; it is rhe cauſe that an elect ſoul pleaſes God, in faſting, whatching, wearing hair cloath, kneeling, travelling, keeping Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginity, induring death for defenſe of Faith; ſince then in the par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular judgment theſe bodies receiv'd not the ſalary, nor the paine, which they merited in this life, there ought to be another judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, which recompences, or punishes them according to their de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerts.</p>

He exerciſes his patience from the beginning of the world, He employs in it not one day, month, or year, but many ages. He exerciſed it above ſix thouſand Years, and He will exerciſe it to the end of ages, towards all ſinners: but He will not execute the laſt judgment, the act of his great wrath, but at the end of time, as late as poſſible; and that He may find but few upon whome to exerciſe the ſame, He forewarns them of it: He frightens, threatens, and ſends Prophets: He gives ſignes in heaven and in earth, shewing by this, that He deſires not to ſtrike, that he wills not the death of a ſinner, but that he be converted and do live; and this shews alſo the great and enormous malice of ſin, which provoks and irritats ſo much, a God ſo mild, and mercifull.</p>

            <p n="9">9. They know they shal be damned, not only for their own ſins, but again, for thoſe of others, to which they contributed; And they ſee now clearly, that they contributed to an infinity of ſins in others: either before they were committed, to witt by ill councel: or bad example; or when they were committed, being the cauſe of them, by putting the objects, or the ſubjects, or by giving aſſiſtance to commit them. And after they were committed approving, or not exteriourly diſapproving them: or not avoiding the hante of thoſe that committed them, for to give them a hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour of them.</p>
            <p n="10">10.

            <head type="sub">
               <hi>I believe in the holy Ghoſt.</hi>
            </head>
            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg>T is reported in the Acts of the Apoſtles, that S. Paul <note place="margin">
                  <hi>Acts.</hi> 10.</note> entring into the Town of Epheſus, and finding there ſome Faithfull, demanded of them, if they had receiv'd the holy Ghoſt, and they anſwered, we know not ſo much as that there is a holy Ghoſt. If we should put now the ſame Queſtion to many Chriſtians, they might make the ſame anſwer, or at leaſt, they might ſay, we know not what is the holy Ghoſt. To exclude and banish farr from Chriſtians an ignorance ſo per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicious, the Apoſtles employ this Article to inſtruct us concerning his adorable and amiable Perſon.</p>
            <p n="2">2. They teach us, that He is a Perſon diſtinct from the Father, and the Son; ſince they made us to ſay before, <hi>I believe in God the Father; I believe in Ieſus Chriſt his Son;</hi> and now, <hi>I believe in the holy Ghoſt.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>They teach us alſo, that this Perſon is God with the Father and the Son: ſince they make us ſay, I belive in the holy Ghoſt; They do not only make us to profeſs, that there is a holy Spirit: But to believe in Him, to reverence Him as God, and to love him as our ſovereign Good.</p>
            <p n="3">3. They call him holy Ghoſt or Spirit: which is common to the Father, and the Son; For the Father is a moſt holy Spirit: and the Son likewiſe is a moſt holy Spirit; But they appropriate this name to him: becauſe his Emanation or Proceſſion is ſo farr above our thoughts, and our expreſſions, that there is no language in the world that can expreſs his Perſon, for want of a proper name: And becaus we are accuſtomed to call thoſe things ſpirits,
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:108789:35"/> of whoſe origin and manner of production we are ignorant: So we call the wind, ſpectres, Angells, and our ſouls, ſpirits: and we are likewiſe very ignorant in the production and proceſſion of the holy Ghoſt.</p>
            <p n="4">4. Secondly the Apoſtles appropriate this name to him: becauſe He proceeds from the Father and the Son, as from one only Sour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ce, and not as made or created, nor as begotten, but produced by the Will, by an ineffable way, which Divines term Spiration, a breathing and impulſe of the Will towards the thing beloved.</p>
            <p n="5">5. Thirdly this name is appropriated to him, becaus He is the Spirit of our ſpirit, the Soul of our ſoul, the Life of our life: For He is given to the Souls of the juſt, to animate and govern them. He is not given ſo to a Bishop, or a Prieſt, in his ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation, if he be in the ſtate of ſin: He is not in him, to ſanctify him, but to operate and act by him. Hence it is that a Bishop or a Prieſt that is in ſin and hath not grace, gives never<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theleſs the grace of God by the Sacraments, becaus he is the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrument of the holy Ghoſt: as a penne gives to paper characters which it hath not, becaus it is the inſtrument of rhe Writer.</p>
            <p n="6">6. The Church moreover appropriated to this glorious and holy Spirit, the name of Love and Charity, becaus He is produced by the Will, the authour of Love, or by the mutual love and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lection of the eternal Father and the Son.</p>
            <p n="7">7. From this ſecond name which the Church attributes to the holy Ghoſt, proceeds the third, which is that of <hi>Gift, Donum Dei Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſſimi</hi> the Gift of the moſt high. For that which is do<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> by pure love, is do<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> freely and liberally, and donation is a free and liberal action. The two firſt names appropriated to the holy Ghoſt referr him to the Father and the Son; but this of Gift relates him to Creatures that are ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pable to receive him and to enioy him, as are men and Angells only: and this Gift is the firſt: the moſt neceſſary: and the moſt excellent of all gifts that God ever gave, or can give to us.</p>
            <p n="8">8. He is the firſt and cauſe of all the reſt: for there is a great difference 'twixt the love of God, and the love of men. When we love any one, 'tis becaus we find in him ſome good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, ſome beauty, or other Perfection. Gods love ſuppoſes not its object in any creature, but He puts it in them; God begins
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:108789:36"/> not to love us with a love of Benevolence becaus we are good: but we are good, becaus He loves us; ſo when the eternal Father gives us his only Son in the Incarnation: He gave us firſt his Love: and He gave not to us his Son, but by his holy Spirit, and by his Love: <hi>He was conceived of the holy Ghost. So God loved the world, that He gave his only begotten Son.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="9">9. This Gift is ſo neceſſary, that without it all the other Benefits profit very little: the work of creation is appropriated to the Father; the Incarnation to the Son, the Sanctification to the holy Ghoſt; the two firſt Benefits are unprofitable to us with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the third. In the creation God gave us Being, He made and deſign'd for our ſervice all the creatures of this world: But our Saviour ſays to us: <hi>What profit hath a man, if He should gaine the whole world and loſe himſelf:</hi> and he will loſe himſelf infallibly, <note place="margin">
                  <hi>Luke.</hi> 9. 25.</note> if the holy Ghoſt ſanctifys him not. The Incarnation and the Death of the Son of God<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> would not much availe us without the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming of this holy Spirit; the torments of JESUS would have made him die, and not have made us live: He might have ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfyd, without reſtoring us to grace; a king offended by his Vaſſal, may receive from him ſatisfaction, and not receive him into favour, nor reſtore him to his former ſtate, and to the priviled<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges which he had loſt. When I ſee the Saviour in the Crib or on the Croſs, I know not whether it be to ſatisfy only, or moreover to reſtore us to the rights we loſt by ſin: when He riſes up again from death, I know not whether it be for recompence of his death, or to give us life: When He aſcends to Heaven, I know not whether it be to give a convenient place ro his Body, or to prepare alſo a place for us; But when He ſends the holy Ghoſt to ſanctify us: He aſcertains us that we reenter into grace, and that He applys to us his merits, <hi>He hath ſealed us, and given the pledg of the Spirit in our</hi> 
               <note place="margin">2. <hi>Cor.</hi> 1. 22. 1. <hi>Ep.</hi> 4. 13.</note> 
               <hi>hearts,</hi> ſays S. Paul. And the beloved Diſciple. <hi>In this we know that we abide in him, and He in us, becaus He of his Spirit hath given to us.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="10">10 What admirable favour, and what incomparable grace, that God vouchſafs to give us his Spirit, Love, divine and admirable Heart: If one should give to a Philoſopher the ſpirit of Ariſtotle or of Plato: to an Orator the ſpirit of Cicero or Demoſtenes: to a Phiſitian, the ſpirit of Hypocrates or of Galen: and to a Divine
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:108789:36"/> the ſpirit of S. Thomas or of S. Auguſtin, would not this be a ſingular favour? God gives you not the ſpirit of Ariſtotle, Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cero, Hypocrates, but his own Spirit, the Spirit of Verity<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, and Sanctity. When one hath the heart of a perſon, one hath all; If you be in the ſtate of grace, you have the heart of God; for properly ſpeaking, the holy Ghoſt is the heart of God. ô Father of mercies, and Father of the miſerable! how deigne you to give them your heart? Tis that choſen ſouls are your treaſure. and you put your heart upon your treaſure, <hi>Quid retribuam Domino?</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="11">11. What acknowledgment, what ſatisfaction, and what return can we make? Love is not pay'd but by love: nothing correſponds to a heart but another heart: and what heart can correſpond to the heart of God? What love can anſwer his? Would you not deſire to be all heart? Would you not wish to have as many millions of hearts, as there are drops of water, and grains of ſand in the ſea: would you not referr, apply, and conſecrate them to the love of God? And what would this be compared to the heart of God, which He hath given us? It would be leſs than a grain of duſt compared to all in Heaven and in Earth. But He deſires not ſo much; He demands but only one: but He will have it all: He commands you to give it him: <hi>Thou shalt love thy God with all thy heart;</hi> and if you refuſe it him, He will damn you eternally. What horrible ingratitude is it to give ones heart to a Creature, to a foolish paſſion, to a shamefull pleaſure, and not to love God after a gift ſo precious? to refuſe him our poor little heart, after He hath given us his? What monſtrous malice is it to offend the holy Ghoſt, who is the end and the <hi>non plus ul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tra,</hi> the Center and the conſummation of all the liberalities, and donations of God to us.</p>
            <p n="12">12. His ſcripture teaches us, that we offend Him in dlvers manners: either reſiſting, or in contriſtating, or affronting him, or by extinguishing him in our hearts; S.

            <head type="sub">
               <hi>I belieue the holy Catholick Church the Communion of Saints.</hi>
            </head>
            <p n="1">1. <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>He Apoſtles by theſe Words make us to believe that CHRIST hath a true Church or Societie of faithfull people upon earth: And they oblige us to ſubmit to all, that this Church propoſes to be believed, as a matter or an Article of Faith.</p>
            <p n="2">2. This Submiſſion is ſo neceſſary that unleſs we believe the Church, we cannot reaſonably belive any Point of Faith; Nay we cannot ſo much as know what things are to be believed. For we cannot be aſcertained and aſſured, but by the Church, that they have been revealed.</p>
            <p>Some will ſay, that they are aſſured by the holy Scripture of what is revealed, and learn in it, what is to be believed.</p>
            <p n="3">3. But how know they which is holy Scripture? And how know they, that the Goſpells are the Word of God? God never appeared to them, to tell them, this Book printed in ſuch a place is my Word, is my Scripture. The Bible alſo ſays not, I am holy Scripture; And if alſo it should ſay ſo, it should be in this ſuſpected: ſince it gives teſtimony of it ſelf: and ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther book might ſay I am the Word of God, I am holy Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, and we ought not to believe it.</p>
            <p>They will ſay, the Scripture is known by its own light, to be divine: or a light within them, makes them ſee that 'tis the Word of God.</p>
            <p n="4">
               <pb n="66" facs="tcp:108789:38"/> 4. If this were ſo: How could it com to paſs that there should be hardly one book of Scripture, that hath not been reje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted; The Marcionits rejected the five Books of Moſes: the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicheans rejected the Prophets: the Albigenſes, the Pſalms, and all the ancient Teſtament: the Ebionites received but one of the four Goſpells, to wit the Goſpell of S. Matthew: the Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>donites admitted but one part of the Goſpell of S. Luke: Lu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther rejected the Book of Iob, Eccleſiaſtes, the Epiſtle to the Hebrews, that of S. Iames, and that of S. Iude: the ſecond of S. Peter, the two laſt of S. Iohn, and the Apocalyps: all which books the Calviniſts and our Proteſtants in England admit as holy Scripture.</p>
            <p>How coms it, that Proteſtants in England and in France do ſee divers books to be the Word of God, which Proteſtants in Germany and other parts do not?</p>
            <p>And How does the whole Catholick world admit divers bocks to be Canonical, which Proteſtants reject as Apocryphal? If there were any ſuch light in the Books by which they diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver themſelves to be certainly divine: or in men by which they ſee them to be the word of God: all muſt neceſſarily ſee the ſame Books to be Canonical: and all would acknowledg the <note place="margin">
                  <hi>Lib. cont. Epiſt. Funda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>menti Cap.</hi> 5.</note> ſame: ſince the ſame Faith is neceſſary for all; And S. Auſtin would not have ſayd, <hi>that He would not believe the Goſpell, if the authority of the Church did not move him to it:</hi> for he would have ſeen them to be divine.</p>
            <p>Muſt we not then neceſſarily believe the Church and learn of her which is holy Scripture, And what is to be believed? And ſince we have not the original of one only Canonical Book: muſt we not believe the Church and truſt her for a faithfull Copy?</p>
            <p n="5">5<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> But ſuppoſe that God gave the Bible in English, and that He ſayd, this Bible printed at London is his Scripture; I ſay again, that we muſt yet believe the Church and rely on her for the ſenſe and meaning of it. For S. Peter in the ſame Bible ſais, <note place="margin">1. <hi>Pet.</hi> 3. 16.</note> 
               <hi>in the Epiſtles of S. Paul there are things hard to be underſtood, which the unlearned and the unstable deprave, as alſo the rest of the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, to their own perdition.</hi> Note <hi>perdition.</hi> Have not Diſputes controverſies and conteſts always riſen concerning the ſenſe and
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:108789:38"/> meaning of them, and that in matters of the greateſt importance? Have not the beſt copies of the Bible been conſulted, and all paſſages confer'd, the controverſies ſtil remaining and increaſing?</p>
            <p>Doe we not ſee that divers and contrary Parties do confident<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly affirm that they have the true ſenſe and underſtanding of the Scriptures: and that conſequently they make to themſelves Faiths, Religions, and models of Government to the utter deſtruction, of Vnity, Peace, and Charity it ſelf? Is it not then Neceſſary for the avoyding of Hereſies, and Diviſions, and for the preſerva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Vnity and Peace, to harken alſo in this part to the Church, and to adhere to her ſenſe of the holy Scripture? Wherefore the Apoſtles oblige us to follow her, and to reſt in her judgements; <hi>to diſpute againſt whom.</hi> S. Auſtin with great reaſon, tells us, is <note place="margin">
                  <hi>Ep.</hi> 1</note> inſolent madneſs.</p>
            <p>And leſt we might doubt which among all the Societies of men in the Chriſtian world, is the dwelling place of Faith, the ſpring of truth, an the true Church of the living God; the Apoſtles mark her out to us by three evident Notes, which are proper to her, and diſtinguish her from all other Churches; they teach us that she is <hi>One, Holy, Catholick.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="6">6. Firſt they teach us that She is <hi>One:</hi> for they make us not to ſay, I believe Churches, but, I <hi>believe the Church;</hi> which is the kingdom of the Son of God, his flock, and myſtical Body. You never find in the Goſpell, that the Son of God hath many kingdoms, many flocks, many myſtical Bodys; But always one kingdom, one sheepfold, one myſtical Body. In S. <note place="margin">
                  <hi>Matt.</hi> 4. 23. <hi>Ch.</hi> 13. 41. <hi>Iohn.</hi> 10. 16. <hi>Rom.</hi> 12. <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 4. v. 4</note> Matthew, JESUS <hi>went about preaching the Goſpell of the kingdom.</hi> And again He ſays in the Same Goſpell, <hi>that He will ſend his Angells, and they shal gather all ſcandalls out of his kingdom. There shal be made one fold and one Pastor. We being many are one Body in Chriſt, One Lord, one Faith, One Baptiſme.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="7">7. I demand now the Church of England, is it the true Church? if ſo: the Proteſtant Church in Holland is not: that in Germany is not: that in France is not; there is but one true Church, and theſe are many; they have nothing that uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tes them: they depend not one of another, they have not the ſame Superiour.</p>
            <pb n="68" facs="tcp:108789:39"/>
            <p> But among Catholicks, many Bishopricks, many Republicks, Nations, and Kingdoms are one Church, becaus they are united in the ſame Spiritual Head, or ſupream Paſtor.</p>
            <p n="8">8. You will ſay, that which unites us is Faith: we are one Body by the Vnity of Faith. But beſides that this Vnity (which alſo excludes not Schiſmaticks) is not enough to make one Church: We need not but look into the books of Luther, Calvin, Zuin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>glius to know the war they make with one another: We need not but to read the Works of their ſucceſſours to ſee their diſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greement in Points of the greateſt importance. There is nothing for example, ſo important to Faith, as to know which are the Canonical Books, in which we ought to learn the Chriſtian Verities, and they agree not, as we have ſeen, in them. And if they agree not about the prime Principle: How can agreement be expected in the things which are drawn from thence? Many differences might be named, about moſt important matters; their purſuit alſo of thoſe differences demonſtrats they do not judg them light: which ſtretches to the condemning one another for Here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticks, and Schiſmaticks, and ſometimes to breaking into open arms one againſt another.</p>
            <p n="9">9. But Catholicks however divided by countrey, language, particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar intereſt, civil diſſentions, or war: Yet agree exactly in all points of Faith; If you go to France, Spain, Poland, Italy, or the Indies: You will ſee that they teach the ſame Doctrine, that they make every where the ſame Catechiſmes.</p>
            <p n="10">10. And are not there, ſome will ſay to me, Thomiſts, Scotiſts, And other Parties who diſpute continually? Yes, but this is not, but in ſchool difficulties, in Philoſophical Points, in Queſtions grounded upon humane reaſon: as concerning Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticles of Faith, All agree in them: not one contradicts: not one queſtions them.</p>
            <p n="11">11. Secondly the Apoſtles teach us that the true Church is <hi>holy<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> I believe the holy Church;</hi> This is not to ſay, that All that are therein are Saints; For she is the field of the husbandman, <note place="margin">
                  <hi>Matt.</hi> 3. 21. <hi>Matt.</hi> 13. 47. <hi>Ron.</hi> 9. 21</note> where the Cockle is mixt with good corn. She is the net which takes and holds bad fiſh with the good. She is the houſe, where there are Veſſells of ignominy with thoſe of honour. She is the
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:108789:39"/> Arke of the true Noah, where there are clean and unclean ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>malls. <note place="margin">
                  <hi>Gen.</hi> 7. 2<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
               </note> But the true Church is holy, becaus she hath means to Sanctify her ſelf, and many obtain it by thoſe means. We ask it there, and obtain it of God, by Sacrifice: It is given by Sacraments; conſerv'd by the obſervance of the commandements of God: increaſed by the practiſe of good and vertuous works.</p>
            <p n="12">12. But Reformers have forbidden all theſe ways: they have abolished among them the only ſacrifice of the Maſs; they have diminished the Sacraments: of ſeven that CHRIST inſtituted, they retain but two: Baptiſme and the Euchariſt, which alſo they have made almoſt unprofitable. For they ſay that Baptiſme is not neceſſary for their children, and ſo deprive them often of this remedy, to the excluſion of them out of the kingdom of Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, according to the expreſs words of the Son of God. They have uſed yet wors the Euchariſt; inſtead of the real Preſence <note place="margin">
                  <hi>Iohn.</hi> 3. 5.</note> of our Lord and Savior, Source of all ſanctity, who ſanctifys our ſouls and bodys in this Sacrament: they have not in their ſupper but a morcel of bread, an inefficatious and empty Sacrament, which contains not what it ſignifiys.</p>
            <p n="13">13. As concerning the Commandements, beſyds that they pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ach but thoſe which Moſes gave, and not thoſe which JESUS-CHRIST added to ſanctify his Church: they ſay, that they are impoſſible, alſo with the grace of God. And what man will undertake to execute that which he judges to be impoſſible?</p>
            <p n="14">14. As touching good Works, they deny the worth and me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit of them; And who will undergo difficulty to practiſe good works, when he believes that they have no worth or merit: that faith only juſtifys, and ſuffices to ſalvation; if theſe principles do not usher in the neglect of all good works: it is not becaus the Doctrins do not afford it, but becaus they act by ſome other motives. What Sanctity then may one expect, where there is no Sacrifice, to obtaine it of God: No efficatious Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, where by to receive it: No poſſibility to obey the Commandements of God, to preſerve it: no good works to increaſe it? So they ſay not, S. Luther, S<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Calvin, S. Beza, as they ſay S. Gregory, S Bernard, S. Bonaventure, whom they confeſs to have been of the Roman Church; and expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rience
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:108789:40"/> shews, that there are none ſo holy, ſo vertuous, ſo perfect: None ſo devout towards God, charitable towards their neighbor, ſo ſober, chaſt, modeſt, and humble, as are innumerable Souls, who live entirely according to the maxims and the inſtructions of the Catholick Church.</p>
            <p n="15">15. Thirdly, the Apoſtles teach us, that the true Church of CHRIST is <hi>Catholick:</hi> that is to ſay Vniverſall, or generall: and the Apoſtles by putting this word oblige us to follow that Church whoſe Faith and Religion is receiv'd, and publickly profeſt, the longeſt Time: by the moſt Perſons: and in moſt Places: and ſo the Faith of the Roman Church hath been.</p>
            <p n="16">16. Read but the Annales of Baronius, or of Gualterus: or <note place="margin">The lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gueſt Ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>me.</note> the works of Bellarmin, or Coccius, and You will ſee that ever-ſince the Apoſtles, the Church hath had from age to age the ſame Articles of Faith, which the Roman Church teaches at this preſent. Reformers confeſs that during the firſt four hundred years, the Roman was the true Church: if this Preſent were new: they ought to shew, who was the firſt Authour of this novellty: what was the new doctrin that was taught: in what time: and in what place: f<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>om what Church the Roman did ſeperate, when she embraced this new doctrin: and who were they that oppoſed this novellty? Theſe things are noted in every little alteration of Religion: and one cannot shew them in the great pretended changes of the Faith of the Roman Church.</p>
            <p n="17">17, All thoſe that have been converted to the Faith of CHRIST, <note place="margin">By the moſt per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons</note> and have embraced Chriſtian Religion, have always taken the Ro<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>man, and were converted by Romaniſts; Other Religions con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vert not infidells, and have never extended the Empire of IESUS in any Province of the Earth.</p>
            <p n="18">18. We muſt put out our Eyes, and burn all Hiſtories, not <note place="margin">In moſt Places.</note> to ſee that the Roman Church only hath been extended in all the places where IESUS CHRIST is or hath been adored: and that no other Congregation of Chriſtians has ever had pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick exerciſe of Religion throughout the world. But we may read in S. Ireneus, Tertullian, S. Cyprian, and S. Athanaſius that in their times the Catholick Church was already in all the inhabited Earth: and this in accomplishment of what David
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:108789:40"/> had often foretold, ſaying that the Reigne and Empire of JESUS CHRIST, that is to ſay, CHRISTS Church should be extended throughout all the earth; <hi>I wil give thee Gentills for thy inheritance, and thy poſſeſſion the ends of the Earth; He</hi>

               <hi>shal rule from ſea to ſea, and from the river even to the end of the round world.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="19">19. Follow then the Faith of the Romane and Catholick Church, ſince theſe Notes evidently agree to Her, and to no other church: <note place="margin">
                  <hi>Heb.</hi> 11. 6.</note> and ſince with out true and entire Faith; <g ref="char:punc">▪</g>tis impoſſible to pleaſe God.</p>

                  <hi>Gallatians</hi> 5. 20</note> himſelf, does teach expreſſly, <hi>that not Sects only, but alſo Diſſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, Diviſions or Seperations shal not poſſeſs the kingdom of God.</hi> Wherefore S. Cyprian in the book of Vnity ſays, Whoſoever ſeperats from the true Church, is excluded from the promiſes of the Church, and who hath abandoned the Church of CHRIST shal never com to receive the recompences of CHRIST: He is a ſtranger, he is prophane, he is an enemie of God; for He connot have God for his Father, who hath not the Church for his Mother.

<pb n="72" facs="tcp:108789:41"/> laboured in the vineyard reciv'd the recompence of the pennie, that is eternal life. Members that remain not united to the body, cannot have life. Branches cut of from the tree, cannot bring<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forth fruit. IESUS CHRIST is the Saviour of his Body, which is the Church. He is the Eſpouſe of the Church, and cannot have or acknowledg other children, then thoſe of his Spouſe.</p>
            <p n="21">21. Let us then reſolve to live and die in the boſome of the Catholick or Roman Church. There we may avoid damnation: there we shal be aſſisted to obtain Salvation; For there is <hi>Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion af Saints:</hi> that is, communication of good works, and of prayers; There then every one may help his neighbor: the Living may ſuccour alſo the Dead in Purgatory: and the Saints in Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven can help by their merits and their prayers, ſinners upon Earth; Amen.</p>

            <p n="1">1. <seg rend="decorInit">H</seg>E that should know well the monſtrous nature and malice of Sin: the ingratitude, impudence, and inſolence of the ſinner: the infinite Greatnes, San<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctity, and Majeſty of him againſt whom it is com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted: and should alſo know, what the Scripture expreſſly tells us, that a God is thereby irritated, exaſperated, put into anger and fury againſt the ſinner; ſuch an one I ſay, could not by any light of reaſon hope for pardon: it would ſeem to him impoſſible, that ſins committed againſt God, should be remitted: and he would need the light of Faith to believe that a ſinner may obtain remiſſion of them. Who would ever think that a God, who hath need of none: who had not reſpect to the
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:108789:41"/> celeſtial Principalities, and who ſpared not ſo great a number of noble Spirits, but condemn'd them all without exception, to eternal flames, would shew favour to worms of the earth, to ſo ungratefull and baſe creatures, after they have ſo many, and ſo many times offended Him, multiplying ſins upon ſins, and reiterating the ſame ſins? Here then we have need of Faith; and therefore the Apoſtles make us to believe, that God will pardon ſins; and ſince they except none, that He will re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit all ſorts of them, how ever great and enormous they may be, by the Sacrament of Baptiſme: and after by Abſolution, as often as we shal do true penance for them.</p>
            <p n="2">2. Here we meet with an error, and one of the moſt great, and moſt pernicious of ſome Reformers. They ſay, that it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longs not to a ſinner to abſolve others from their ſins: and that it is an injury to the Son of God, to ask pardon of our ſins of any other. On this account, they do ill in believing, that they being ſinners, can by Baptiſme wash away the ſins of others: and do injury to the Son of God, by going them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, or by carrying their children to their Miniſters to have their ſins remitted by this Sacrament: ſince it belongs to the Son of God to wash away ſins by Baptiſme. Heaven declar'd this Verity to S. Iohn Baptiſt: <hi>Vpon whom thou shalt ſee the holy Ghoſt</hi> 
               <note place="margin">
                  <hi>Iohn.</hi> 1. 33.</note> 
               <hi>deſcending, He it is, that Baptizes.</hi> But who is ſo weak, that does not anſwer eaſily, that they baptize on the part of God, in his Name, and by his Command: that they go not to their Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſters, as men, but as God's Deputies and Vicegerents to be baptized? I ſay the ſame of Abſolution: we abſolve from ſins, not of our own ſelves: but in the Name of God: as his Depu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, and Miniſters, by the Power, Authority, and Commiſſion which He hath given us.</p>
            <p n="3">3. Behold the Commiſſions and Patents of it, <hi>Whatſoever You shal</hi>

            </p>
            <p>Theſe words of our Saviour are as clear as the Sun: but let us ſuppoſe they have need of interpretation; To whom shal we recurr for the interpretation of them? To one that came a
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:108789:42"/> 100 or ſixſcore years ago, or to the ancient Fathers of the firſt ages, when according to Reformers themſelves the Church was in her purity? S. Chryſoſtom ſpeaks great things vpon this ſubject, <note place="margin">

               </note> and ſeems to have foreſeen all the evaſions of Reformers. Firſt he ſays, that the Son of God communicated to his Apoſtles the ſame power that He received from his Father; and this great Saint ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aks ſo, after our Savior himſelf; For in the ſame time He ſayd to his Diſciples, whoſe ſins you shal remit, they are remitted: He ſayd to them, <hi>I ſend you, as my Father ſent me;</hi> But our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vior had not only power to declare that ſins are remitted by faith, but He had power alſo to remit them. In the ſecond place S. Chryſoſtom ſays: If a king should give to a favourit power to impriſon, and to deliver priſoners, what favour would this be? Yet this would be nothing if compar'd with the power of Prieſts; there is as much difference 'twixt theſe powers, as between heaven and earth Thirdly he ſays, that the Prieſts of the old Law, had not power, but to judg the leaproſie of the body, and to judg of it only, not to cure it; ours have power to judg of ſin, which is the leaproſie of the ſoul, and alſo to cure her of it <note place="margin">

Auſtin ſays, let no body flatter himſelf, ſaying, I confeſs in my heart, I confeſs to God: this is not enough: and on this account, in vain the Son of God would have ſayd to Prieſts: <hi>All that you shal unbind on earth</hi> And S. Ambroſe ſpeaking to the Nova<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tians who ſayd that men have not power to remit ſins, ſays, Why baptize you if men have not power to remit ſins? for Baptiſme is the remiſſion of ſins; and what if Prieſts attribute to themſelves the power that is given them, either by Baptiſme, or by Penance?</p>
            <p>Let us leave Diſſenters: and conſider the wonders of this Power, that we may with thoſe in the Goſpell glorify God, who gave ſuch power to men. I confeſs that there are not many Miſteryes in our <note place="margin">
                  <hi>Matt.</hi> 9.</note> Religion which I more admire than this; and you will admire it with me, if you conſider with me the circumſtances of it.</p>
            <p n="4">4. The firſt is, that this Power is Divine, it pertains not properly but to him who receiv'd an injury to remit and pardon it; It belongs then to God to remit offences againſt him. Wherfore the Phariſees hearing our Savior ſay to the Paralitick, <hi>thy ſins are forgiven thee,</hi> and not believing that He was God, thought that
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:108789:42"/> He blaſphem'd. What would they have then thought? what wou<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>d they have ſayd, if they had known, as we know, that JESUS CHRIST would give to men, and to ſinful men, this Power?</p>
            <p n="5">5. A Power in the ſecond place ſo ſoveraign, that 'tis defi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitive without appeal. The ſentences which Prieſts pronounce, and all that they juſtly ordain on earth, is ratifyd infallibly in heaven. When you have confeſt with neceſſary diſpoſitions, if the Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt ſay to you, <hi>I abſolve thee</hi> &amp;c. fear not that God will condemn you: He cannot fail in his promiſe; and He promiſed to abſolve you, if the Prieſt abſolve you legitimatly.</p>
            <p n="6">6. And this is don with ſo much Authority and Majeſty, that this Power is perfectly Royal; for the Prieſt abſolves not praying: If he should ſay over you the <hi>miſereatur</hi> only, or should pray God to abſolve you, you would not be abſolv'd; JESUS-CHRIST wills that he ſay, <hi>I abſolve thee;</hi> and heaven and earth shal melt rather than you shal fail of abſolution, how ever great and enor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous your ſins may be.</p>
            <p n="7">7. This is a fourth Circumſtance of this Power, that it is moſt ample, abſolute and general, without exception, reſtriction, or modification; For there is no ſin which the Church cannot re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit: ſince the Son of God hath ſayd abſolutely and without re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve: <hi>Whoſe ſins you shal remit, shal be remitted.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="8">8. But that which is to be admired moſt in this Power, is the facility and convenience we have to vſe it. 'Tis true, that having committed a ſin, it is not ſo eaſy as ſome think, to have a true repentance of it; We muſt ask it inſtantly of God, and indeavour to obtain it of him by good works. But when we have obtain'd it what is more eaſy than to find a Prieſt, who may abſolve us? Have we not great cauſe to be aſtonished, and to cry out? my God! How have you been ſo liberal, as to give this Power to your Church, and to ſo many Prieſts? If you had gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven it but to the Pope, or to Patriarks, or to Bishops, or for one only time of the life of each one: the exceſs of liberality would not have ſeem'd ſo great; but for always, for ſo many times, and to ſo many Prieſts: What exceſs of love, of grace, and mercy? ô how will a ſoul that conſiders well thi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> Benefit melt with dilection? how will she burn with the love of ſuch
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:108789:43"/> a Benefactor? How often will she kiſs thoſe ſacred wounds? How often will she bleſs that adorable Blood, which purchaſed her ſo great a good? How often will she ſay, <hi>my ſoul bleſs thou our Lord.</hi> On the contrary, What regretts shal we have in hell, if we are damn'd, for having neglected, contemn'd, or prophan'd ſo great a Benefit?</p>
            <p>The devout Rupertus was wont to ſay, he had no pity on Chriſtians that were damn'd; and when one ſayd to him, why have you not? if a dog should be ſo afflicted, we should be mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved to compaſſion. I have none, ſayd he, for 'tis their fault, they have well deſerv'd it: ſince they might have ſaved themſelves ſo eaſily.</p>
            <p n="9">9. But th'o we have ſo much convenience to make uſe of this great Benefit, and to help our ſelves by this Power; Yet if we should be ſo ill adviſed, as to loſe the grace of God by conſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting to a mortal ſin, we should hazard our ſalvation. Wherefore the Royal Prophet adviſes us, that if we have innocence, to take great care to keep it: to be ſolicitous not to offend God: and for <note place="margin">
                  <hi>Pſal.</hi> 36.</note> this effect, to remember, that He is juſt: and that his juſtice obliges him to punish ſinners: and to favour and ſave the Juſt. Beware to ſay when temptation ſolicits you: J'le taſt the ſweet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes of this pleaſure: I will ſatisfy my deſire: when I have taken my pleaſure, and contented my paſſion I will do penance: I'le go to confeſſion and be abſolu'd. Will you do penance? you might do it, if it depended but on you: if you could do it of your ſelf. But the Son of God ſays to you in the Goſpell, <hi>You can do nothing without me;</hi> you cannot then do penance, if God does <note place="margin">
                  <hi>Iohn.</hi> 15.</note> not make you do it: you cannot have repentance, if God does not give it to you. This gift is an effect of his benevolence, and You provoke his vengeance by your ſin; tis an effect of his goodneſs: and you draw ſeverity; tis an effect of his mercy: and you irritate his anger; The ordinary effect of his anger is to abandon a ſinfull ſoul: to deliver her up to the tyrannie of her paſſions: to let her fall from ſin into ſin, from precipice into precipice; The people <note place="margin">

               <pb n="77" facs="tcp:108789:43"/> 
               <hi>do fall,</hi> And yet more terribly by Ezechiel, <hi>if the Iuſt ſhal be turn'd from his Iuſtice, and shal do iniquity, I will lay a ſtumblingblock before</hi>

            <p n="11">11. But you will ſay, the grace of God is ſo powerful, that there is no underſtanding ſo blind, but He can enlighten it: no heart ſo hard, but He can ſoften it: no will ſo rebellious but He can overcom it; Tis true; But God hath not promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed his Victorious grace to any ſinner in particular: He owes it to none: and He refuſes it to many.</p>
            <p n="12">12. But hath not our Saviour ſayd, <hi>I will not reject him that coms to me?</hi> Yes, but He adds, <hi>Nobody coms to me unleſs my Father draw him.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="13">13. But S. Auſtin Says. <hi>Are not you drawn? pray God to draw you;</hi> and the Son of God makes us this promiſe: <hi>Ask and you shal receive:</hi> Yes, you shal receive all that you ask as you ought and as God wills you to ask: otherwiſe you will ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain nothing; for S.

               <hi>you receive not; becaus you ask amiſs;</hi> You ask not ſo much, nor in the manner, as a thing ſo precious deſerves to be demanded, ſays S. Auguſtine. Salomon prayed God to give him Continence, and he asked it not ſlackly or tepidly, but with his whole heart as the Scripture tells us: and yet he obtain'd it not; he became about his old age, moſt carnal and voluptuous: becaus
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:108789:44"/> he asked it not with that confidence and perſeverance, which God required of him; As when the holy Scripture Says: <hi>He that shal invocate the name of our Lord, shal be ſaved:</hi> this is not to ſay, all they that invocate him in what manner ſoever; but they that invocate him with the faith, piety, and purity of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience that God requires. Do you not then ſee, that by conſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting to a mortal ſin, You hazard your ſalvation, that you en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>danger your happy eternity? You may be ſurpriſed in this ſtate by a ſudden and unprouided death, which arrives daily by ſo many accidents. If it should not: Yet you will not get out of this mire, if God draw you not out of it; and He being not obliged: 'tis a doubtfull caſe whether or no He will; All the aſſurance you have of it is a perhaps; If you commit the ſin, perhaps God will draw you out of it, exerciſing his mercy in reſpect of you: perhaps he will leave you in it, exerciſing his juſtice upon you; the firſt is not more to be hop'd, then the ſecond is to be fear'd. Nay, experience makes us ſee, that in this caſe more are the objects of his juſtice, then of his mercy; for we find more that fall into the ſecond, third, or hundredth ſin, then they that truly riſe after the firſt; And if you have difficulty to reſiſt a temptation now, when you are power<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully aſſiſted by God: how will you when theſe great helps shal be drawn from you? If you do not when you are free: how will you when you are a ſlave of ſin? If you do not when you are well cover'd and armed with the grace of God, and gifts of the holy Ghoſt: how will you when you shal be na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked and unarm'd? If you do not when you are ſtrong and in good health: how will you do it when you shal be weak and wounded? Are you then in the ſtate of grace?

               <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg>T was ſo neceſſary that this Article should be well eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blished in our faith: that after the Apoſtles had made the Faithfull to profeſs it in their Creed: S. Paul yet proves it by many Arguments: He ſolves alſo the objections that might be made againſt it: and aſſures us ſo much of it, that he ſays, <hi>if our Bodys do not riſe again, neither is</hi> CHRIST <note place="margin">
                  <hi>Cor.</hi> 1. 15. <hi>Cor.</hi> 2. 5. 10.</note> 
               <hi>riſen up again</hi> And in the ſecond to the Corinthians <hi>We must all be manifeſted before the judgment ſeat of</hi> CHRIST, <hi>that every one may rece<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ive the proper things of the body according as he hath don, either good or evill.</hi> For juſtice requires that we be recompenced, and chaſtiſed in the ſame things which have contributed to good or evill; But the greater part of ſins are cauſed or Committed by the body: 'tis then reaſon that it riſe again and feel the punishments due to them. It concurrs likewiſe to vertuous actions: 'tis mortifyd by holy ſouls, ſubjected to rigours of penance, and to labours of a chriſtian life: it ſufferrs priſons and punishments in Confeſſors: torments and death in Martyrs: 'tis deprived of its pleaſures in Virgins, and in Widows, and crucifyd in all true Chriſtians; it is then very juſt that it should participate in the ſatisfactions, pleaſures, and recompences of Heaven. The flesh, ſays Tertullian, is the <note place="margin">Tertull. de Reſur. Carnis.</note> hinge of our ſalvation, and if the ſoul be united to God, 'tis it that gives her capacity; the flesh is washed to the end the ſoul be cleanſed: the flesh is annointed, that the ſoul be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecrated: the flesh is shadowed by impoſition of hands, that the ſoul be illuminated in Spirit: the flesh is fed with the Body and Blood of JESUS-CHRIST to the end the ſoul be nouriſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hed
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:108789:45"/> by God; they cannot then be ſeperated in recompences ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving been ſo joyn'd in actions.</p>
            <p>And 'tis vain to alleadg againſt this Verity the low condition of the flesh; for the ſame Father ſays: the flesh which God form'd to the reſemblance of a man-God: which He animated by his breath, to the reſemblance of his life: which He fortifyd with his Sacraments: of which He loves the purity, approves the auſterity, and eſteems the labours and the ſufferances, shal it not riſe again? It will never be that He leave in eternal death the works of his hands, the care of his Spirit, the tabernacle of his Breath, the heir of his Liberalities, the keeper of his Law, the Victime of his Religion, and the Siſter of his CHRIST: It will then be raiſed up again; and in this, God does as a Pot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter: who ſeeing his Pot ill made, breaks it, to repair it better; ſo God having form'd man of earth, and finding him deprav'd by ſin, broke him by death, to which he doom'd him: but with deſign, to repair and make him better, in the day of the Reſurrection.</p>
            <p n="2">2. But if any one should aske me, how that which is wi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thered and rotten, can becom living and flourishing again? He needs not but to conſider the Omnipotency of the Creator: or with S. Paul the grain of corne, which rots, to riſe again: <hi>Foole,</hi> 
               <note place="margin">1. <hi>Cor.</hi> 15. <hi>Cgryſol. Ser.</hi> 59.</note> 
               <hi>it firſt do die.</hi> All things in this world, according to S. Chry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſologue are images of our Reſurrection: the Sun ſets, and riſes: the day is buried in darkneſs, and returns: months, years, ſea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons, fruits, ſeeds, die in paſſing, and riſe again returning; and to touch you with a ſenſible example, as often as you ſleep and wake, you die in a certain manner, and riſe again. Let us now reflect upon the words of this Article.</p>
            <p n="3">3. The Apoſtles ſay not The Reſurrection of the man, though this he true, But <hi>of the flesh:</hi> for to teach us that when the man dies, his ſoul dies not: and therefore in the Reſurection, is nor raiſed-up again: but reunited only to the body; ſince no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing can be raiſed again to life, unleſs it firſt be dead.</p>
            <p n="4">4. They ſay not the Reſurrecton of the body, but of the flesh becaus the holy Ghoſt would afford us a means to Confute the
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:108789:45"/> errour of certain Hereticks, who would suſtain, as in the firſt ages of the Church ſome did, that we should riſe, not in a body of flesh, but form'd of air.</p>
            <p n="5">5. They uſe moreover theſe terms, to convince orhers, who in the time of the Apoſtles thought, that the Reſurrection of which the Scripture ſpeaks, ſignifys not that of the body, but only that by which the Soul is raiſed out of the death of ſin to the life of grace.</p>
            <p n="6">6. In fine, this word <hi>Reſurrection</hi> makes us underſtand, that we shal receive the ſame bodys which we had; for ſince riſing again ſignifys returning to life again: It muſt be the ſame flesh which was dead, that riſes and returns to life.</p>
            <p n="7">7. We All then shal have the ſame bodys which now we have, but intire and perfect, without want or ſuperfluity: without the imperfection of youth, or the defect of old age; None shal riſe blind or purblind, deaf or dumb, lame or crooked, too great, or too little: nor with any other defect or imperfection. Becaus 'tis God alone, whoſe works are perfect, that will raiſe us up: He will not in this work make uſe of natural cauſes, from which all defects proceed.</p>
            <p n="8">8. Nevertheleſs the Reſurrection of the Elect, and that of the Reprobate will be very different; The bleſſed Souls shal receive bodys like to Chriſts, endowed with Light, Subtility, Agility<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and Impaſſibility: that will shine as clear as Starrs: that will penetrate and paſs through althings, as beams of the Sun through glaſs: that will move as ſwiftly, as lightning. That will be impaſſible and immortal, ſo that nothing in the world can hurt them. They will enter into their bodys with great joy and gladneſs: with many benedictions and congratulations: ô my body! ſuch a ſoul will Say: ô my dear companion and moſt faithfull friend! receive now with ioy, the fruit of thy labours, mortifications, and pains in the works of holineſs: thou haſt been in miſeries, and in ſufferances: be thou now in felicity and in happineſs: and let us praiſe together the Authour of our good. but the reprobate Souls will reenter into their bodies with great a verſion, rage, and many maledictions of thoſe members which they go to animate. for to render them ſenſible of ineffable and eternal torments.</p>

This doubtleſs we shal do, if we conſider and ponder well: What is Eternal Life? and how great are the goods of it?</p>

And on the contrary, eternal life is, when they are freed from thoſe and all other evills, and do enjoy the eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal Goods of heaven.</p>
            <p n="3">3. Theſe are ſo great, that the Apoſtle, who was rapt up into heaven, would not deſcribe the Greatneſs of them: he ſpeaks not of them but with aſtoniſhment: <hi>neither eye hath ſeen,</hi> ſays he, <hi>nor eare hath heard, nor hath the heart of man conceiv'd, what God <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

            <p> Nevertheleſs, for to attain to ſome knowledg, or rather to ſome ſlender conjecture of their greatneſs: fourt hings shal be conſidered.</p>
            <p n="4">4. Firſt the liberality of God towards all men in this life: caſt the eyes of your conſideration with S: Auſtin<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> upon the extent of the Vnivers: ſee what ſtately buildings there are: what cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers richly furnished: what beauteous gardens: what pleaſant me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dows: what odoriferous and coloured Flowers: what ſorts of ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vory fruits: what delicious meats: what delicate wines: what ſweet odours: what melodious voices: what ſumptuous garments: what dogs for chaſe: what birds of prey, for recreation: It is God that gives all theſe things to men; But to what men? And who are they that more uſually enioy them? Atheiſts, Infidells and others that forget him, and inceſſantly offend him. Now if He do ſo much good to his enemies, what will he reſerve for his fri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ends? If He be ſo liberal to give: how much more to recompence? if He be ſo charitable to thoſe that offend him: how much more to thoſe who love him? if He be ſo magnificent to thoſe He owes but punishments: how much more to thoſe to whome He hath made ſo many promiſes? Run through in your mind all that you have ever ſeen, heard, or imagin'd: all that is great, rich magnificent, precious, pleaſant, and deſirable: all that is nothing if compar'd with that which God hath prepar'd for you, if you love him; for all that may be ſeen, recounted, or deſired: and it is impoſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to ſee decipher, or deſire the great goods which God hath pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſs'd, and prepar'd for thoſe that love him.</p>
            <p n="5">5. To have a ſecond conjecture of them, you need not but weigh and conſider the iourneys and toyles of Apoſtles: the tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of Martyrs: the watchings and auſterities of confeſſors: the temptations, combats, and Victories of Virgins: the alms and charities of Widdows: the heroical vertues of other Saints: and that after ſo many toyles, ſo many ſufferances, penances, mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifications, good works, ſervices, merits, the Apoſtle ſays, that <note place="margin">
                  <hi>Rom.</hi> 8. 18.</note> the very ſufferances and afflictions themſelves of this life, are little in compariſon with the glory of heaven. And again, <hi>the tribulation which at preſent is momentary and light, works above meaſure excee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dingly an eternal weight of glory in us:</hi> note <hi>above meaſure exceedingly.</hi> 
               <note place="margin">2. <hi>Ior.</hi> 4. 17.</note>
            </p>
            <p n="6">6. Nevertheleſs a third conſideration will make this weight of
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:108789:47"/> glory to ſurpaſs yet much more all value and eſteem of it; For Heaven is not only the Salary of the Saints, but alſo the recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pence of the merits of JESUS; Conſider what He is in his divine Perſon: what He is with God his Father: the ardent love He had for him, the Zeal which He had for his Glory: the great ſervices He did him: what He ſuffered for his honour, what his pretious Blood is worth; the Glory of Heaven is the Salary of all that, given by a King moſt liberal in his gifts, and moſt magnificent in his recompences.</p>
            <p n="7">7. Hell alſo, though very low, may ſerve us for a footſtool and a ſtep to mount up to Heaven by contemplation, and to make a gueſſe at the felicities of it. What is hell? 'tis an abyſs, a Collection, a Rendevow of the moſt exceſſive ſorrows, bitter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſes and afflictions imaginable. What is it to be damn'd? 'Tis to be eternally in a priſon moſt deep, moſt obſcure, and moſt incommodious: to be eternally in captivity, under a Tyrant moſt inſolent, moſt cruell, and moſt barbarous: not to have one mite of bread in an eternal and moſt ravenous hunger: not a drop of water, in a moſt burning thirſt: not a ray of light in the greateſt darkneſs: not a moment of reſt in an unſupor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table and eternal wearineſs: to be eternally afflicted with all the miſeries a humane body is capable: to be continually burning in a moſt violent fire without conſuming. To be in an eternity of regret, ſorrow, vexation, rage, and horrible deſpair; It is ſo great a good to be exempted from theſe pains, that according to S. Auſtin, and S. Gregory, the juſtice of God leaves the reprobate in thoſe miſeries, that the elect may know their great happineſs and felicity in being freed from them, by the grace of God: <hi>Vt liberatus de non liberato diſcat quale ſuppli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cium ſibi conveniret, niſi gratia ſubveniret;</hi> And they shal not only be perfectly deliver'd from them: but they shal have quite con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary favours: and not the contrary only, which we may poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſibly conceive: but moreover ſuch as cannot com into the thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ghts of a mortal man. When then the Scriptures tell us that the Saints poſſeſs God perfectly: that this infinite Good holding the place of all things ſatisfies all their deſires, and makes their ſouls moſt happy: that they shal be brought into the houſe of
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:108789:48"/> God with eternal joy and gladneſs: and that they shal be inebri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ated with the plenty of his houſe, and in the torrent of his pleaſures He will make them drink: all theſe and the like ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſions give us only ſome obſcure notions, imperfect images, or shadows of that ineffable Glory, which hath not aſcended, as the Apoſtle ſays, into our hearts.</p>
            <p n="8">8. And it is not only the Viſion and the Fruition of God, the joy and delectation which flow from them, which the Apoſtle ſpeaks of in thoſe words; But alſo the particular joys, and accidental glorys and Laurells that Saints shal have given them there, according to their combats and victories here; to Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tyrs ſuch an one: to Confeſſors ſuch a one: to Doctors ſuch a one: to Virgins another, as it pleaſes him; which particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar Glorys what they shal be, how ineſtimably delightfull they shal be to us, and how gracefull in the ſight of others, we nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther know, nor can know here. If then the leſſer things be ſo great, what is all Heaven? What is God who is the ſumme and ſubſtance af all reward and felicity? I doubt not, but all Chriſtians believe more then any man can ſay of them: and I doubt as little, but they thinke them well worthy their ſtudy and care, and of their paines and coſt.</p>
            <p n="9">9. But what is the paines and coſt that belongs to them, which men and women ſo shrink at? Is it loſs of life or limme? Not ſo: but in caſe of Martyrdom. Is it to give all to the Poor? No: though CHRIST adviſed it one, if he deſired to be per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect. Is it to ſuffer burning or the paines of hell for them? Not ſo: and yet S. Auſtin and Venerable Bead wished with all their hearts to feel hells torments a good while, to be ſure of them: ſo great was their apprehenſion and value of heavens greatneſs!</p>
            <p n="10">10. Why do they not then to obtain a happy and eternal life, that which they do to preſerve this unhappy and languishing life? Thy deprive themſelves of meats which prejudice their health: they renounce all divertiſments which may probably diſtemper them: and they quit all that is moſt pleaſing when it may be hurtfull to them. Why do they not as much to obtain the happy life? When they labour ſo much to preſerve this miſerable life, they
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:108789:48"/> defend themſelves not from death, and all that they can pretend to by the order of their diet, and by their remedies, is not to live always, but only to die a little later. Let them do as much for the other life, and teſtify by their actions that they have beliefe, love, and eſteem of it, and they shal live eternal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly.</p>
            <p n="11">11. How much would you give ſays S. Auguſtine to be <note place="margin">
                  <hi>Auguſtine ſer.</hi> 64. <hi>de Verb. Dom.</hi>
               </note> exempt from ſuffering, and to be aſcertain'd to live always? You would think all which you poſſeſs, would not ſuffice to buy ſo great a good<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> though alſo you should poſſeſs the whole world; Nevertheleſs this good, and what is yet infinitely more excellent is to be ſold: You may buy it if you will: and you need not trouble your ſelf about the price of it: for it is rated but at what you have; you may purchaſe it by alms: obtain it by good works: merit it by good deſires: acquire it by becomming a vertuous perſon. Contemne then not ſo great a happineſs, which depends not but of gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ce, and your free will; and if you have any love of your ſalvation, ſo run, as the Apoſtle bids you, that you may obtain. The chief ennemie to this vertuous cours, is an idle, uncertain, and unſetled life. Let us buſie our felves then always in ſomething which is good. Let us have a certain and ſetled form and method of our pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctiſes, which we will not without neceſſity omit: and we shal ſo run as by the grace of God, we may obtain a moſt happy end. Reſolve from this preſent moment upon this cours, exclude all dalliance and delay: and pronounce after the Apoſtles with mouth and heart this word, Amen.</p>

            <head>DISCOURS XVI. OF FAITH.</head>
            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">H</seg>E that shal examin by the touchſtone of holy Scripture, the value and worth of every thing, will acknowledg vith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out difficulty, that amongſt the chriſtian vertues, one of thoſe that honour God the moſt, And of the moſt important to our ſalvation, is Faith the firſt Theological vertue. For if S. Paul writing to the Romans, ſays, that when we em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ploy <note place="margin">
                  <hi>Rom.</hi> 12. 1.</note> our bodys in the ſervice of God, by mortification, and the practiſe of good works, we offer to God a very acceptable Hoſt, ſurely, when we captivate our underſtandings in obedience to Faith and mortify them, forcing them againſt their inclination to receive and approve the Articles of our Faith, which are obſcure, and incomprehenſible: this ſacrifice cannot fail to be much more accepta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble and pleaſing: ſince we offer to him our Spirit, which is incom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parably more excellent and noble.</p>
            <p n="2">2. If Faith be ſo glorious and acceptable to God: it is no leſs profitable and neceſſary to men. For <hi>He that believes and is baptized ſhal be ſaved: but he that belives not shal be condemn'd. By Faith, the</hi> 
               <note place="margin">
                  <hi>Mark.</hi> 16. 16. <hi>Heb.</hi> 11.</note> 
               <hi>Ancient obtain'd teſtimony that they were juſt and pleaſed God: But with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out Faith it is impoſſible to pleaſe him.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="3">3. A Diſſenter or libertine Catholick hearing this will ſay: I am aſſured of my ſalvation: nothing is neceſſary to it, but Faith and Baptiſme; thanks be to God. I belive and am baptized. I shal then infallibly be ſaved. You ſay true: if you have true and living Faith: if you have ſuch faith as God demands of you: for there is Faith, and Faith: there is humane faith and divine Faith: ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitual faith, and actual faith: implicit faith, and explicit faith: Interiour faith, and exteriour faith: dead faith, and living faith.</p>
            <p n="4">
               <pb n="89" facs="tcp:108789:49"/> 4. Humane faith is an aſſent to a propoſition upon the ſimple teſtimony of men.</p>
            <p n="5">5. Divine faith is a ſpecial gift of God, by which we firmly hold for true all verities revealed upon the aſſured and aſcertain'd teſtimony of God, who cannot deceive, or be deceived. Habitual faith is, when 'tis permanent as a habit, and remains in us 'til we loſe it by infidelity. Actual faith is, when we exerciſe formally and expreſly an act of beliefe upon a revealed Verity. Implicite is, when we believe not the Articles of Religion, but confuſedly, in general, and in gros, as when we ſay, I believe all that the Church believes. Explicit is, when we believe diſtinctly and in par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular, that there is one God in three Perſons, that the Son of God was made man, and the like important verities. Interior faith is, when we believe in heart, without making known by any ſigne whether we believe or no. Exteriour is, when we make pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion of our belief by words, or by external and viſible actions. dead faith is, when it is depriv'd of the love of God, and of other vertues. Living faith is, when it is animated by charity, and the practiſe of good works.</p>
            <p n="6">6. Humane faith conduces not to juſtification, nor conſequently to ſalvation; this the Apoſtle expreſsly teaches, when he ſays, <hi>By</hi> 
               <note place="margin">
                  <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 2. 8. 2. <hi>Cor.</hi> 5. 2.</note> 
               <hi>grace you are ſaved through faith, and that not of your ſelves, for it is the gift of God.</hi> And again, <hi>we are not ſufficient to think any thing of our ſelves, but our ſufficiency is of God.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="7">7. Habitual faith ſuffices not for an Adult, or one that hath ſufficient uſe of reaſon; but he muſt believe actually the Myſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries of faith. For <hi>he that coms to God, muſt believe that He is, and that He is a rewarder of them that ſeek him,</hi> ſays S. Paul: And S. <note place="margin">
                  <hi>Heb.</hi> 11. <hi>Iohn..</hi> 3. 18.</note> Iohn, <hi>He that does not believe, is already judged;</hi> He ſays not, he that hath not faith, but he that does not believe: which ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſes a formal act. I ſayd, habitual faith ſuffices not one that hath ſufficient uſe of reaſon; for infants and ſuch as have not the uſe of reaſon may be ſaved by habitual faith, which they receive when they are ſpiritually regenerated by Baptiſme. For this habitual gift of faith, and the other habitual and ſupernatural gifts of Hope and Charity, which they then by the merits of CHRIST receive, juſtify them, makes them adoptive children of God,
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:108789:50"/> heires of his kingdom, and remains in them for theſe effects, and to be the ſources of correſpondent acts, when they shal com to the uſe of reaſon.</p>
            <p n="8">8. Implicit faith ſuffices not to be ſaved; It is not enough to ſay, I believe all that the Church believes: you are oblig'd to know and believe explicitly, that there is one God in three Perſons, Father, Son, and holy Ghoſt, Creatour, Saviour, Sanctifier: the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>carnation of JESUS-CHRIST, his Nativity, Death, Reſurrection, Aſcenſion, his comming to Judgment; if any one committed to your care should be ignorant of theſe Miſteries, you would be more cul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pable, then if you should permit them to work on Chriſtmas day, this being only againſt a precept of the Church: that againſt a Comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dement of God. And for the ſame reaſon, if others, who do not particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larly pertain to you, should be ignorant of thoſe myſteries, you would offend againſt charity if you inſtruct them not, more then if you should leave them in ignorance of their obligation to hear Maſs on Eaſter day.</p>
            <p n="9">9. Interior faith ſuffices not; It is not enough to have a firm faith in our heart, we muſt make a profeſſion of it by our words <note place="margin">
                  <hi>Rom.</hi> 10. 10.</note> and actions; <hi>For with the heart we believe vnto juſtice: but with the mouth Confeſſion is made to ſâlvation,</hi> ſays S. Paul. We receive body and ſoul, and all from God: we muſt acknowledg, and honour him as He commands us, though with the loſs of all. <note place="margin">1. <hi>Cor.</hi> 13. <hi>Galat.</hi> 5. 6. <hi>S.

            </p>
            <p n="10">10. Dead faith in fine ſuffices not, for <hi>if a man hath all faith and have not charity, he is nothing,</hi> ſays S. Paul. And in another place he aſſures us, that <hi>the faith only which works by charity is that which profits and conduces to ſalvation.</hi> S. Iames confutes largly dead faith, and thus concludes, <hi>You ſee then Brethren, how that by works a man is justifyd and not by faith only.</hi> Our Saviour himſelf de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clares it inſufficient to ſalvation, when He ſays, <hi>Not every one that ſays Lord, Lord</hi> (which is not ſayd without Faith) <hi>but he that does the will of my Father, shal enter into the kingdom of Heaven.</hi> And in the ſame Goſpell, He blames thoſe He ſends into everlaſting fire, not becaus they believ'd not in him: but becaus they did not good Works; and this paſſage S. Auſtin alſo urges much againſt the Solifideans.</p>
            <p n="11">11. Catholicks believe this: but many among them fail in
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:108789:50"/> the practiſe of it. What Chriſtian works, what ſupernatural works conformable to their faith, and what works more perfect than thoſe of Pagans, do they? Tbey labour to maintain themſelves, to nourish and provide for children, and the Pagans did ſo; They honor their Parents: the Pagans reſpected alſo theirs; they injure none: and honeſt Pagans did not; They love their Benefactors: I will not ſay what Pagan, but what Tyger does not? They love their friends, and ſuch as do love them: <hi>the Publicans or Pagans, do they not the ſame? and what reward shal you have?</hi> ſayd our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour. You muſt do works conformable to your faith, ſupernatural, <note place="margin">
                  <hi>Matth.</hi> 5. 46.</note> heroical, and worthy of the recompence we pretend to.</p>
            <p n="12">12. A good Chriſtian acts not by natural inclination, nor by humane reaſon, nor by maxims of policie, nor by temporal in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſt, but hath faith for the Principle of his actions, and for the Rule of his life.</p>
            <p>He labours and gains money, not for the love of it, nor of any honour, or pleaſure he may get by it: but for a neceſſary en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertainment of himſelf in the ſervice of God, and to give Alms: becauſe faith teaches him to uſe it for theſe ends. He nourishes and provides for children, not becauſe they are his, but becauſe they are Gods creatures, his Images, and the Members of JESUS-CHRIST. He abſtains from ſenſual delights and carnal pleaſures, not becauſe a man is too noble and born to higher things than to be a ſlave to his body, but becauſe JESUS-CHRIST recommended it. He does no injury to any, not becauſe he would have the repute of an honeſt man, but becaus JESUS hath forbidden him. He ſuffers in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juries and affronts, and pardons them, not becauſe it is the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perty of a great courage to contemne and look upon them as un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worthy of his anger, as a Lyon or an Elephant ſlights the cries of little dogs, but becauſe CHRIST commands us to pardon injuries, to do good to thoſe that hate and perſecute us.</p>
            <p>He ſerves faithfully his Maſter, not becaus his Maſter nourishes him well, and gives good wages, but becaus God ſayd by the mouth of S. Paul, <hi>Servants render obedience to your Maſters as to</hi> JESUS-CHRIST. He gives alms to a poor man, not through tenderneſs of heart, but becauſe JESUS hath commanded him: and ſayd, <hi>that which you shal do to the leaſt of mine, shal be don to me. Who</hi>

               <hi>Have faith:</hi> It is the extream miſery of a Chriſtian to loſe Faith; whilſt it ſubſiſts in the ſoul, there remains always ſome hopes of ſalvation; when it is once loſt, all is loſt: there is no recovery, but by a miracle.</p>
            <p n="14">14. Have divine faith, not humane only; You ought to believe what I ſay to you, not becauſe I ſay it, but becaus God sayd it: becaus God revealed it to his Church, and the Church teaches you it by my miniſtery. Divine faith believes all the words of the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, without exception; if you believe ſome and not the other, it is humane faith, or opinion, or phanſie, not divine faith, which believes, becaus God is the ſoveraign and infallible Verity, who cannot deceive in any point; if He could in one, He might in all the reſt.</p>
            <p n="15">15. Have actual faith, not habitual only; It is very profitable to exerciſe often formal and expreſs acts of faith, eſpecially in temptation, and in occaſion of Sin: to do as our Savior, who being tempted in the deſart, oppoſ'd to each temptation a text of holy ſcripture; And S.

I ſay voluntarily: For when thoughts do riſe againſt faith: if they diſpleas you: or if you reject them promptly, as ſoon as you perceive them, there is no Sin. But to avoyd the occaſions of them, do what S.

            <p n="17">17. Have explicit faith: content not your ſelves to ſay, I am a good Catholick, I believe all Articles of faith: but learn them in particular, at leaſt the principall and moſt remarkable. To learn

            <p n="2">2. To reconcile this and the like apparent Contrarieties, we muſt remember that though our hope be founded upon the promiſes which God made us, through his infinite Goodneſs, and the me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits of his Son; Yet theſe promiſes are not accomplished, with out the concours and cooperation of our free Will. On the ſide of the promiſes of God, there is nothing to be doubted, our hope is moſt certain, and cannot be deceiv'd; but our free will being fragil and inconſtant, we have cauſe to fear, that being wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting to the grace of God, and to what He demands of us, we render our ſelves unworthy of the goods, which his mercy pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſ'd and prepar'd for us. The faults which are uſually commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted in this matter of hope, may be reduced to three principal, We hope not what we ought to hope; or not of whom we ought to hope: or not as we ought to hope. To avoyd theſe defects, and to practise well this important Vertue: I will shew what we ought to hope; of whom we ought to hope; and how we ought to hope.</p>
            <p n="3">3. <hi>My God you are my Hope,</hi> ſayd the Royal Prophet; Note ſays S. Bernard, that the Prophet ſays not only, my God I hope in you; but he ſays, <hi>You are my Hope.</hi> when you ask of God health, long life, proſperity, you hope in him; but 'tis health, long life, proſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perity, which is your hope, that is to ſay, the object and the ſubject of your deſires, pretentions, and affections; but the holy Prophet made God his hope; and in effect, God as the Authour of <note place="margin">

This Good then merits to be deſires, purſued, and expected by him: and if he should do otherwiſe, he would not only be extreamly wanting to himſelf: but alſo highly injurious to this Good: who only is capable to give him the accomplish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of his laſt perfection.</p>
            <p n="4">
               <pb n="96" facs="tcp:108789:53"/> 4. But as faith aides the underſtanding to believe in God, as its prime and principal object, aides alſo to believe many other things that are reveal'd by him, as its ſecondary and leſs prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipal; ſo Hope which aſſiſts the will to hope God as its prime principal and chief object, helps it conſequently to hope many other things that proceed from God, and which ſerve to compleat the beatitude of man, or as means to attain it.</p>
            <p n="5">5. Our Lord's prayer is an abridgment of all that we ought to hope, as the Symbole of the Apoſtles is a compendium of all we muſt believe; And in this moſt excellent and perfect prayer which the Son of God put into our mouths, we aske no corporal thing, but what is preciſely neceſſary, our daily bread; we beg not wordly Glory, nor earthly riches, nor eaſe or pleaſures for our bodys, nor the ſatisfaction of our paſſions; if we hope or beg <note place="margin">

To hope God will accomplish ſuch deſires, is it not to injure him? Is it not to make Him a ſervant of your ambition, a complice of your avarice, and a partener of your paſſions? if you should hope in Iupiter, if you should pray Mars, Venus, Cupid, if you should pray a Devill, you would not ask of him other favour; and to ask thoſe things of the true God, to demand them in the Name of his Son, to hope to obtain them by the interceſſion of the Saints: ſenſual pleaſures, by the interceſſion of the B.

<pb n="101" facs="tcp:108789:55"/> of God, who placed all our felicity and happineſs in a thing ſo ſweet, and conformable to our nature: And which poor as well as rich, ignorant, as well as learn'd, weak and ſick, as well as ſtrong and healthy, and in a word, all the world may have by his Grace. And becauſe He deſires that we bee perfect, and wills that we be happy, He commands us to love him.</p>
            <p n="3">3. <hi>Thou shalt love the Lord thy God.</hi> Vpon which S. Auſtin<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 
               <hi>Quid mihi es? miſerere, ut loquar: Quid tibi ſum ego? ut amari te jubeas a me, &amp; niſi faciam minaris ingentes miſerias, parva ne eſt ipſa miſeria ſi non amem te?</hi> O my God! have pity on me, pardon me if I am bold to ſpeak, being but duſt and ashes; what is this to ſay that you command me to love you? ought one to command a Vaſſal to love his Prince? an Infant to love his Father? a Spouſe to love her Eſpou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſe? a Creature to love the Creator. are not you my So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veraign, my Father, my Eſpouſe, my All, and my Creator? Nevertheleſs you threaten me with great miſeries if I love you not; is there in the world a greater miſery then not to love you? is it not the miſery of miſeries to be depriv'd of your love? You command me to love you: what mercy! 'Tis too much honor to have the permiſſion of it, a Vaſſall would not dare ſay to his Prince, Sr. I love you; he may ſay, I honor your Majeſty, I have much affection for your ſervice: but not I love you: and I may ſay it to my God, not only without temerity, but with much merit: He permits it, He deſires it, He commands it.</p>
            <p n="4">4. Nevertheleſs we have this misfortune among many others, and which is not of the leſſer; that we often make more ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of things which we ought to conſider leſs. You find many who ſay this day is the feaſt of S. Matthew, to morrow Ember day, or Eaſter is at hand: we muſt hear Maſs, faſt, prepare our ſelves for communion: You find very few that ever ſayd in their lives we muſt make an Act of the love of God: and ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vertheleſs it is a commandement of God, which obliges more ſtric<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly than thoſe of the Church: it is the firſt and greateſt com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandement: it is an affirmative commadement: Note <hi>affirmative;</hi>
               <pb n="102" facs="tcp:108789:56"/> the affirmative Precepts are thoſe which command ſome action: the negative are thoſe which forbid to act; to obey negative com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandements, we need not but abſtain from acting: to obſerve theſe commands, <hi>Thou shalt not kill, Thou shalt not ſwear, Thou shalt not Steal,</hi> there is no need to do any thing, 'tis enough to abſtain from killing, ſwearing, robbing. It is not ſo in the affirmative. We fulfill them not by doing nothing, but by practiſing Acts which they command; Now the Commande<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of loving God is affirmative, which obliges to expreſſe and formal acts, and without doubt obliges ſometimes: and men think not of it. They employ every week half an hour at leaſt in hearing Maſs, to obey the command of the Church: 'tis well don: and if they did not, they would offend God; But how coms it to paſs, that they employ not half a quarter of an hour, nither every week, nor every month, nor every year to make an act of the love of God, to obey this commandement of God, which our Saviour published with is own mouth, <hi>thou shalt love thy God.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="5">5. Belive me, and you will believe one that deſires your ſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation with all his heart; reſolve from this preſent to employ ſome little ſpace of time in the exerciſe of the love of God: and give it the qualities and conditions of true love: els it is not Charity, and loſes its value and its merit. The love of God muſt have at leaſt three qualities; It muſt be a love that is Soveraign, Pure, and Active.</p>
            <p n="6">6. The love of God is a love of preference: it will be a king, or nothing: it cannot live without reigning, and it cannot reign but Soveraignly. The Son of God ſays in the Goſpell. <hi>He that loves father or mother more than me, is not worthy of me:</hi> 
               <note place="margin">
                  <hi>Matthew.</hi> 10. 37.</note> 
               <hi>and he that loves ſon or daughter above me, is not worthy of me;</hi> And to shew, that we ought not only not prefer them before God: but that we ought to poſtpoſe them much, and to neglect them for him; He ſays in S. Luke, <hi>if any one com to me and hates not</hi>

            <p n="8">8. He that loves not God more than himſelf, inverts the order of charity ſays S. Proſper; he had reaſon to ſay inverts; Is not this a horrible inverſion, perverſion, and a prodigious diſorder to love a particular good more than the univerſall, the ſtream more then the ſource, the ray more then the ſun, the image more than the prototype, the nothing more than the All, the creature which is but duſt and putrefaction more then the moſt high, moſt excellent, and infinite Majeſty of the Creator?</p>
            <p n="9">9. It is this diſorder that makes that a mortal ſin, alſo in a thing which ſeems not to be of great importance, does merit hell; It ſeems very rigorous to damne one for ſtealing a crown; but you muſt not only regard the value of a crown, but that you make more account of a piece of a ſilver, then of God himſelf, ſince you will loſe his amitie and Him for it.</p>
            <p n="10">10. In the ſecond place, the love of God muſt be a pure and diſintereſſed love; S. Paul ſays nor only that charity ſeeks the <note place="margin">1. <hi>Cor.</hi> 13. 5.</note> the glory of God, and his divine intereſts, but that it ſeeks not its own intereſts: <hi>Non quaerit quae ſua ſunt.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>S. Thomas treating of this Verity concludes with all Divines, that charity is not a mercenary love, a love of profit and of intereſt: but a free and diſintereſſed love, a love of amity and benevolence, a love by which we will good to God, not for the love of our ſelves, but for the love of him: we love him not in regard of our profit, but in regard of his goodneſs: not becaus He does good to us, or that He may do us good, but becaus He is good, and deſerves to be loved; for God, is ſo good, great, holy, powerfull, and worthy to be loved, that if He did deſire
<pb n="104" facs="tcp:108789:57"/> it, we should ſacrifice our ſelves for his ſervice, though there were neither heaven for thoſe that love him, nor hell for thoſe that love him not.</p>
            <p n="11">11. We should do as the bleſſed Spirits do: it is IESUS that gives the Counſel, putting theſe words into our mouths, <hi>Your will be don in earth as it is in heaven:</hi> that is as the Angells do it; they do the will of God and obey his Orders, with a free, pure, and diſintereſſed love: all that they pretend is to obey God, to do his will, all the recompence that they paſſionately deſire, is to receive new Orders, to be employd again in his ſervice, purely for the love of him.</p>
            <p n="12">12 This is not ſayd, that a faithfull ſoul may not hope, and keep the commandements for reward or retribution as the Prophet ſays he did: But that it be not the principal, yet leſs the only aime of our love? for as S. Bernard ſays, perfect love of God intends no recompence, but merits much. The loving ſoul receives from the hands of God ineffable and incomprehenſible goods: but though she should not, though there should be no Paradiſe, nor reward, she would not omit to love God, ſerve him, and to be pleaſing to him: and if she practiſes vertue for reward: the reward which she deſires is the increaſe of her love; if she is glad to merit to be higher in heaven, this is not to have there more of honor and glory, but it is to have more of love: if I merit much ſays she, I shal ſee God more clearly and perfectly in heaven, I shal glorify him more excellently, I shal praiſe him more advanta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giouſly, I shal be united to him more ſtrictly and intimatly, I shal love him more ardently; and ſo love is the true ſalary<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> of love.</p>
            <p n="13">13. In fine your love muſt not be idle and paralitick, but active to render ſervice to God, and to do good works for his glory: <hi>Charity works great things where it is, and where it works not, there it is not,</hi> ſays S. Gregory. <note place="margin">

            <p>
               <hi>He that loves me will keep my word,</hi> ſays IESUS. <hi>My little children,</hi> ſays his beloved Diſciple, <hi>let us not love in word and tongue only, but in work and veritie;</hi> and the Royal Prophet, <hi>You that love our Lord hate ye evill;</hi> he ſays not only commit not evill: but hate it: He ſays not hate it in your ſelf, but abſolutely hate it; If you love God, you will hate ſin, whereſoever it is found:
<pb n="105" facs="tcp:108789:57"/> you will deſtroy it in your ſelf, and in your neighbor alſo, if if you can; if one should ſay, I abuſe not my friend, but is not ſorry that another does, nor hinders him when he can, may one truly ſay, he loves him?</p>
            <p>Let us conclude with a reflexion upon theſe words of JESUS, I <hi>Came to caſt fire upon the earth, and what deſire I but that it be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flam'd?</hi> 
               <note place="margin">
                  <hi>Luke</hi> 12. 49.</note> And does He not move, ſolicit, and ſtir up our hearts to this fire and flame of love by all poſſible wayes?</p>
            <p n="14">14. <hi>He</hi> prevents us with great love; He lou'd us more than ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches: He was made poor for us; more than honours: He ſuffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red a thouſand infamies; more than his eaſe and pleaſure: He led a life in pain and labor; more than his body: He depriu'd it of glory, and of life; more than the Angells: He redeem'd them not; And though we are ſo ungratful and unworthy as not to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn love for love: He tryes yet other means.</p>
            <p n="15">15. He heaps Benefits upon us, and makes us preſents to engage our mercenary hearts. He practiſes the counſel He gives us by the Wiſeman, and by his Apoſtle, <hi>Give meat and drink to your ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my,</hi>

            </p>
            <p>And if it ſeems to you that all this is too little, and that your he<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>art is yet worth more: He aſſures you, that all the favours whi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ich he hath don you, and which he does you yet every day, are not but gages and pledges of the great Goods He hath prepar'd and promis'd you, if you love him; <hi>Neither eye hath ſeen, nor eare hath heard,</hi> 
               <note place="margin">1. <hi>Cor</hi> 2. 9</note> 
               <hi>nor the heart of man can comprehend the things which God hath prepar'd for them that love him</hi> ſays S. Paul.</p>
            <p n="16">16. But ſince we eſteem not theſe promiſes enough, and are like thoſe Iſraelites who contemn'd she deſirable land: He lifts up his hand: He commands us ro love him, and threatens punishments, if we do not; Is not this to be extremly deſirous of our love, to put as it were a dagger to our throats, and ſay to us, love me,
<pb n="106" facs="tcp:108789:58"/> J will kill you if you will not. He does not only ſay it, but he does it, he damnes us eternaly, if we love him not.</p>
            <p n="17">17. And when He ſees that fear of future punishments doe not ſufficiently move our hearts, He ſends us ſometimes afflictions to force our love: He takes away all you love in this world; becaus you love not well that which ought to be loved above all things; He removes from you all that may amuſe and employ your heart: that it may be in a manner forced, for want of other object, to unite it ſelf to Him; ô great God? what can you do more to have this heart which you ſo paſſionately deſire; you beſige it on all ſides, and it renders not; neither the preventions of your love: nor the at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tractives of your benefits: nor your promiſes of paradiſe: nor your ſtrict commands: nor threats of hell: nor conſtrains of afflictions can open this lockt heart; <hi>Extremis morbis extrema remedia.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="18">18. When a paſſionate lover hath tryed all wayes, and finds them unſuccesfull, he coms to the laſt, makes uſe of a charm, compoſes a love potion: JESUS, makes uſe of this artifice to gain our affection: He puts himſelf upon our Altars, and into our Tabernacles: there he is the charm of love, They ſay that in a charm of love, to render it more powerfull, the Lover ought to mix with it ſome of his own ſubſtance, ſome drops of his blood: and JESUS puts all his blood into this potion: not a part of his ſubſtance only, but all his ſubſtance, Body, Soul, and Divinity.</p>
            <p n="19">19. What think you; Judg you not that God ought to have your heart after ſo many purſuances: do they not inflame you to beg that of God which is ſo neceſſary, and which you cannot have of your own ſelves? Aske it of God fervently, humbly, frequently, aske it of God if you be wiſe: I ſay again once more, and I would ſay a thouſand times to all Chriſtians in particular, ask of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten of God his Love, if you will work your ſalvation: pray the B. Virgin and other ſaints, to intercede for you: give great alms or many little ones that God may give you his love: faſt ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times, pray vertuous perſons to beg it for you, and renonce all that diſpleaſes him: for if God be the object of our love in this life, He will be the object of our viſion, fruition and felicity in the other, Amen.</p>

            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">N</seg>Ature inclines and prompts all creatures to love their like; It obliges us to will, and alſo to do good to others: and teaches us that we cannot deny them good offices, or hate them without renouncing humanity.

                  <hi>S. Pau. Rom.</hi> 38.</note> S. Paul: that is, pay to every one what you owe, ſo that you owe no more: but know, that you muſt pay them the debt of Charity, and owe ſtil more. Let us then ſee: who is our ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ighbor; that we may render to him this debt: and in the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond place, how we muſt pay it to him.</p>
            <p n="2">2. When a certain Lawyer in the Goſpell made this Queſtion, who is my neighbor? JESUS to inſtruct him, propoſed to him <note place="margin">
                  <hi>Luke.</hi> 10. 30.</note> this Parable: <hi>A certain man went down from Hieruſalem into Ieri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cho, and fell amongſt theeves, who robbed him, wounded him, and left him half dead, And it happened that a certain Prieſt went down the ſame way, and having looked upon him, paſſed by.

               <pb n="108" facs="tcp:108789:59"/> 
               <hi>Samaritan going in his way, Came where he was; and ſeeing him was moved with compaſſion. And going to him, bound up his wounds, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving powered into them oyl and wine; and ſetting him upon his beast, brought him to an Inn, and took care of him.</hi> Then JESUS deman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded of the Lawyer, <hi>which of Theſe three, was in his opinion neighbor to him that fell among the theeves?</hi> The Lawer ſayd, <hi>he that ſhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wed mercy to him.</hi> And JESUS approv'd his anſwer, ſaying, <hi>go and do thou in like manner</hi> By which we ſee, that CHRIST for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced him to confeſs, that not only the juſt, not only friends, not only jews, as the Lawyer thought, were neighbours, but a Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maritan was neighbor to a Iew, that is, an enemy was neighbor to an enemy: and Conſequently, every humane creature, though Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan, Iew, Turk, or Heretick, is our neighbour. And this alſo is made evident by S. Paul, who ſays, that all the commandements <note place="margin">
                  <hi>Rom.</hi> 13 9.</note> are comprized in this word. <hi>Thou ſhalt love thy neighbor as thy ſelf;</hi> for if any man whatſoever should not be comprehended under the notion of a neighbor, he would not ſin againſt the precept of lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving his neighbor, who should ſteal his goods, kill him, or bear fals witneſs againſt him, which contradicts expreſly the doctrine of the Apoſtle. We are then oblig'd by this precept to love every man, be he a friend or an enemy, a relation or a ſtranger, a faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full perſon, or an infidell, as we love our ſelves.</p>
            <p n="3">3. But when do we love truly our own ſelves? When we love God truly; for as S. Auſtin moſt judiciously does note, no body lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ves himſelf, unleſs he loves God; and again, ſpeaking upon theſe <note place="margin">
                  <hi>Ep.</hi> 95. <hi>ad Innocent Papam</hi>
               </note> words <hi>Peter loveſt thou me;</hi> tis moſt ſtrange, ſays he, but very true, that he that loves himſelf, if he loves not God, does not love himſelf: and he that loves well God, and loves not himſelf, truly loves himſelf; For we cannot love God as we ought, but at <note place="margin">
                  <hi>Aug. Tract</hi> 51. <hi>in Ioan. ſub med.</hi>
               </note> the ſame time we repair or preſerve our Spiritual life, and procure our Soveraign good; nor can we fail in this love, but we de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prive our ſelves, of thoſe goods, and truly hate our ſelves. If then we love our neighbors as our ſelves, we muſt make them to love God; if they be unfaithfull, we muſt convert them: if ſinners, correct them: and as much as in us lyes make all to obey God, to love him perfectly, and ſerve him faithfully.</p>
            <p n="4">4. But again, when do we love well our ſelves? when we make
<pb n="109" facs="tcp:108789:59"/> God and his ſervice the But and End of our deſignes, enterprizes and actions: when our hearts are in this poſture and diſpoſition: I will be wholy referr'd to God, I will not be in this world but for him: if I recreat my ſelf, this shal not be only to paſs the time, but to preſerve my health for his ſervice, if I nourish chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, it is to the end they ſerve him: if I gain money, it is for a neceſſary Support of my ſelf in the ſervice of God, and to give alms: If I purſue an eſtate or office, it is to have an occaſion to ſerve God, my neighbour, and the Church therein. So we should indeavour that our neighbor ſerve not God accidentally, occaſionally and ſecondarily, that they make not themſelves, nor the advance<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of their families their chief and principal intention, nor the end of their ſtudyes, labours and indeavours; but God, his glory, and his ſervice.</p>
            <p n="5">5. But again when do we truly love our ſelves? We love not well our ſelves ſatisfying our ſenſes, and our paſſions, taking eaſe and pleaſures, and ſeeking the felicities of this world; <hi>for he that loves ſo his life shal loſe it,</hi> Says our Saviour, But we love our ſelves truly when we content our ſelves with what is neceſſary: and when we mortify our paſſions and ſenſualities: and labour for grace and vertue in this life, and for glory in the other. So our love of others muſt not comply with their ſenſualities, paſſions, or defects: but muſt ſeperate what is hurtfull: and procure them what is good and neceſſary in this life, and what may better them for the other.</p>
            <p n="6">6. But once more: when do we truly love our ſelves? When we love our ſouls more then all things of this world: more then eaſe, pleaſure, riches, honor, or life it ſelf, and chuſe to live in pain and labor, in poverty and miſery, in diſgrace and infamy, and to loſe our life, rather than hazzard our ſalvation, or hurt in the leaſt our ſouls; <hi>for what does it profit a man,</hi> ſays the Son of <note place="margin">

Others love their kindred and relations, but with a natural inordinate, and hurtfull love; they procure them what is honou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable, or profitable upon earth, though they put them into eminent danger of loſing heaven; they give them what pleaſes the ſenſes and ſatisfys their foolish inclinations, though to the prejudice of their ſouls and their ſalvation: and if they ſee them deſirous to renounce the world, and to betake themſelves to a vertuous cours of life, they call upon them, and to shew their love, diſwade them from it, and recall them to the uſuall and libertine cours of life; ſo they ſeem to love, but do truly hate, to be good friends, but are the worſt of enemies, and the maxim of our Savior is verefyd in them: <hi>The enemies of a man are his do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mesticks.</hi>

Wherefore the Son of God who endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vours by all means our Salvation, does not only command this charity and mercy, but moreover obliges us to it by other preſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing motives; He promiſes us his greateſt mercy, which is the pardon of our ſins, if we pardon others: <hi>dimittite &amp; dimit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temini:</hi> and he aſſures us that his Father will treat us moſt rigo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rouſly if we do not: <hi>Sic Pater meus celeſtis faciet vobis:</hi> ſo my heavenly Father will caſt you into the priſon of hell, if you for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>give not others from your hearts.

            <p n="2">2. God the omnipotent Creator having repoſed from all Eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity, and ſatisfyd himſelf in the plenitude of his divine Being, in the enjoyance of his infinite Perfections, in the fecundity of his adorable Emanations, in the ſociety of his divine Perſons, and willing by a ſally of love, and by a powerfull inclination of his natural Goodneſs to communicate himſelf out of him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, created man in the beginning of time to his own image and reſemblance, that by grace and particular priviledge, he might be partaker of the ſame felicity, which the Creatour poſſeſſed in himſelf by the prerogative of his Nature.

Satan perceived this, and raging with envie deſir'd to fruſtrate the deſigne, feating that man
<pb n="115" facs="tcp:108789:62"/> whom he eſteem'd much inferiour to himſelf, should merit by his humility and obedience the glory of heaven, which he had loſt by his arrogancy and rebellion; and ſeeing well, that he could not vanquish him by force, made uſe of fraud and arti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice. and having induced him to tranſgreſs the commandement of God, gave him traiterouſly two mortal wounds contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry to the two prerogatives he receiv'd from God in his crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion: Ignorance of good. againſt the light of his underſtanding: Concupiſcence of evill. againſt the rectitude of his will. From theſe two accurſed ſources. have flown all the diſmal evills which deſtroy our nature, and principally the two more nota<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, <hi>Delict, and Crime: Delict</hi> coms from ignorance, <hi>Crime</hi> pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeds from concupiſcence; <hi>Delict</hi> is the omiſſion of good com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded: <hi>Crime</hi> is the commiſſion of evill prohibited; For ſuch infectious wounds two remedies were neceſſary; man had need of counſel and of aide<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>

            <p>This is that wherewith the divine <hi>Word</hi> incarnated for for the ſalvation of men hath enriched us abundantly: who came as S. Iohn ſays, <hi>full of Grace and Verity; Grace,</hi> there <note place="margin">

            <p>You will make known how freely it is given: ſince you gave it in a time, in which men did demerit it by ſo many crimes: in a time, in which the world was proſtituted to ſins ſo black, enormous, and exceſſive that they provoked vengeance inſtead of inviting your mercy.

            <p n="7">7. We cannot of our ſelves prevent and merit it; But we can demerit it, and render our ſelves unworthy of it, by many, great and enormous ſins, as the jews did; Let us not do as <note place="margin">

            <p n="10">10. Nature loves praiſe and glory: to make it ſelf ſeen and known to many: to employ and diſſipate it ſelf in exteriour affaires; Grace loves to be hidden and unknown to the world: it ſeeks recollection and retyrement, peace, and communication with God.</p>
            <p n="11">11. Nature flys all that gives difficulty or paine either to ſoul or body? it ſeeks what is proper and particular: loves its own eaſe and commodity, and referrs all to it ſelf and to its intereſt.

And after this shal we be proud; shal we think to be ſomething of our ſelves? shal we diſdain others?</p>

Bernard ſays, in verity I have learnt that there is nothing ſo ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectual to keep and recover grace, as Humility and Fear: you are happy if you fill your heart with a triple fear; if your fear when you have receiv'd grace: and more, when you have loſt it: and yet more, when you have recover'd it; fear then when grace co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mes: fear when it retyres: fear when it returns; when it co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mes, fear leſt you comply not well with it; when it retyres fear mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>re: becaus you have loſt your ſafeguard: and doubt not but that pride is the cauſe of it, though you know it not: for God ſees that which is hid from you: God who gives his grace to the humble, takes it not from the humble; when then a man is depriv'd of grace, 'tis a ſigne that he is proud. And if it re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turne by the mercy of God, 'tis then you ought to fear much more, leſt you fall into a more lamentable relaps; fear therefore God always and withall your heart: miſtruſt your diſpoſitions how ever holy and good they may ſeem, if they make you proud; God left ſo many ſouls in the way of perdition before the Incarnation, to make you know the neceſſity of Grace, and to eſtablish you in Humility; will He not permit you to be loſt, if you are not humble? fear if you commit great ſins, that God will not give you efficacious grace to raiſe you out of them. Fear if you attribute it to your ſelves, that God will draw it from you; work your ſalvation in fear and trembling: for 'tis God who produces in you the good will and the work; and this is the reaſon why Saints always fear,

            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">S</seg>Ome ſay that Catholicks think to be ſaved by their good works without being beholding to JESUS-CHRIST: by their own merits: not by his; and conſequently that they are the proudeſt, and the moſt ungrateful to God of all people in the world.</p>
            <p n="2">2. 'Tis a ſtrange thing, that they can be ſo miſtaken in our Doctrine: ſince our Church conſtantly and clearly <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

            <p>We belive that no force of nature; nor dignity of our beſt
<pb n="121" facs="tcp:108789:65"/> works, can merit our juſtification: but we are juſtifyd freely by grace, through the Redemption that is in JESUS-CHRIST.</p>
            <p n="3">3. We teach that our following merits or good works ſigniſy no more, than actions don by the aſſiſtance of God's grace, to which it hath pleaſed his Goodneſs to promiſe a reward; a do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine, ſo far from being unſuitable to the holy ſcriptures, that nothing is ſo frequently repeated in them, as God's gracious promiſes to recompence with everlaſting glory the faith and obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience of his ſervants:</p>

So we boaſt not in our ſelves, but all our glorying is in CHRIST. We ſay with S. Paul, that we are naughty and unfaithfull ſervants of our own ſelves: but good and faithfull, as our Saviour ſaies, by the grace of God; that we are unprofitable by our own works: but profitable<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> as S. Paul ſays by the works of grace; and if we ſhould be abſolutely un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>profitable, we muſt expect the ſequel there of, <hi>utter darkneſs</hi> that is damnation.</p>
            <p n="5">5. Beſides good workes of obligation, there are other of Supere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rogation: and at theſe Diſſenters ſtartle much; they hold it a proud and arrogant thing to think, that a man may do more than he is commanded as Catholicks do teach. Yet what more plain in Scriptures? Our Savior ſayes, <hi>there are Eunucks who have made them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves Eunucks for the Kingdom of Heaven;</hi> and this is more than a man is bound to, for he may marry if he will, and yet go to heaven. He ſays again, <hi>If thou wilt be perfect, go and ſell all</hi>

Concerning Virgins, ſayes the Apoſtle I <note place="margin">1. <hi>Cor.</hi> 7. 25.</note> have no command: but I give counſell, plainly diſtinguishing betwixt counſell and command: betwixt that which we muſt do, and what we may do: betwixt we<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="122" facs="tcp:108789:66"/> Catholicks ſay, that God does not require of us all the good that He enables us to do; and this is the ground of works of ſuperero gation, and doing more then is commanded. Now if God do not require all, but only thus much, to do well: then the do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing better then well, is a ſtock which God gives us, to offer Him liberal ſervices, beyond the band of duty. And what pride is it for man, to acknowledg this ſweet providence of his Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tour, and to p<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

We give ſurely by this more honor and glory to God, then they who ſay, that God requires of us all that He enables us to do, yea and more, commanding things impoſſible: and then punishes us for not do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing them. Far be ſuch a thought of God from a Chriſtian heart<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> God commands nothing, but what is honourable, profitable, and alſo eaſy with his grace. That which He demands to ſave us is, that we do good workes conformable to our ſuper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>natural Being, and to the high end to which we are deſigned; that we do them in a competent and convenient Quantity; and that we do not abuſe or loſe the Talents which He lends us, but uſe theſe well in the practiſe of them: as shal be ſeen, God <note place="margin">

               <hi>my hands,</hi> ſince God hath no body, ſayes he, how can one ſeek him with the hands? he anſwers, that is to ſay, with good workes. And this is not that God is hard to beſtow his gifts, and to do good to his creatures: but 'tis that He would do it reaſonably and decently, according to the rules of his providence and infinite Wiſdom. He hath united his glory and our intereſts in procuring our Salvation: He will exerciſe and make ſeen his adorable perfections, his Power, Wiſdom, and incomprehenſible Goodneſſe. The glory of his power shin'd more when he overcame Egipt by an army of flies, when he defea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted Holofernes by the hand of a woman, than when He made uſe of powerfull armies, <hi>Erit memoriale nominis tui, cum manus feminae dejecerit eum.</hi> And this ſame power shines yet more gloriouſly, when He ruines the empire of Satan, beates down the reigne of ſin and of the world, conquers heaven, and beares away the Crown of glory by feeble inſtruments.</p>
            <p>He shews his Wiſdome, which demands that his goods and gifts be not undervalued: that one give them not to the unworthy, who contemne them: 'tis to have little eſteem of them, and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſe them: if we will not labor to obtaine them.</p>
            <p>He makes his goodneſs ſeen, in that he vouchſafes to make uſe of his creatures, in an employment ſo honourable and ſo glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious. We hold it a great honor to be employed by a King in the regency and the government of a Kingdom; how much more honor is it, to be aſſociated with a God in his more great, and noble actions, to conquer the kingdom of heaven, to ſanctify our ſoules, and to enrich our ſelves with chriſtian Vertues?</p>
            <p n="7">7. The Scripture ſpeaking of the glory of heaven, ſayes it is a ſalarie, a harveſt, a crown, for to teach us that if we will be ſaved, we muſt neceſſarily labor, ſow, fight; <hi>Each one shal re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceave his reward according to his labor,</hi> ſays S.

A Soldier that hath play'd whilſt that others fought, would he have the boldneſs to deſire to be crown'd? The Son of God who is our modell, was not contented to deſire our Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation and to demand it of his Father: He laboured for it: and to ſucceed in it, we muſt apply our ſelves to vertuous workes efficaciouſly and ſeriouſly: and in the ſecond place as good trees, we muſt produce theſe good fruits plentifully.</p>
            <p n="7">7. The Son of God ſaies in S. Iohn, <hi>I am the Vine: you the</hi>

Timothy: for behold how he deciphers there an elect ſoule, who aſpires ſeriouſly to the happy life, and who shal obtaine it: she is ſayes he, <hi>a Veſsel unto honor ſanctifyd, and profitable to our Lord, ready and diſpoſed to every good worke;</hi> He ſayes ready or prepared, <note place="margin">2. <hi>Tim.</hi> 2 21.</note> becauſe every one cannot practiſe effectually all good workes: but a choſen ſoul is diſpoſed to do them promptly, when<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever God gives him abilitie and occaſion.</p>
            <p>Theſe Words of S. Paul inſtruct us to employ the Talents, and to cooperate with the grace that God gives us, faithfully. In what conſiſts the fidelity of a ſervant? in that he employes the goods of his Maſter to as much profit as he can: and therefore the ſervant in the Goſpell, who had employ'd well the five talents which were given him to trafick, was called faithfull ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant, <note place="margin">

            </p>
            <p n="9">9. Nevertheleſs, there are very many Chriſtians that make not good uſe of them: there are but few comparatively, to whome one may not ſay, as to the idle ſervant in the Goſpell who hid his Talent, <hi>ſerve nequam, naughty ſervant.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Some have the Talent of a good wit and underſtanding; And in what do they employ this fine wit? to ſpeak a witty word in company: to jeſt pleaſantly: to ſtudy curioſities, and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plements: to make ingenious replyes: to the end they ſay, there is a Lady that hath a great wit: there is a man that knowes how to intertain company; they do as that foolish Emperour, who ſpent the day in chaſing and killing flies with a golden bodkin; they have golden underſtandings which are not employd but to catch flies: the flies of vain glory: of worldly praiſe: of complacencie in them ſelves: and at the beſt, but in the affai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>res of this world; God gave it them to conſider his workes: to contemplate his perfections: to meditate upon the Myſteries of Faith: to conceive acts of repentance: to do good workes: to aſſiſt the poore: to confort the oppreſt; to help widows and or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phans: and to inſtruct the ignorant: and they do nothing leſs: is not this to loſe or abuſe their Talent?</p>
            <p>Others have the Talent of perfect health, a body entire and well compos'd, that they may bear the labours of good and ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuous workes, and the auſterities of penance; and they let this health w<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>ſte away in an idle, ſlack, and faint life. Ladies if you are good Chriſtians, after you have don your devotions, you ought to labor in ſome worke for the Poore, ſince S. Paul does ſay ſo.</p>
            <p>To others God hath given riches of this world to do good with them, to buy heaven, and to redeem their ſins by alms.
<pb n="126" facs="tcp:108789:68"/> if God had don this favour to one man only, to be able to redeem eternal paines with temporal goods, to be able to oblige his Saviour, and to gaine his favour with money, how happy would he be eſteem'd? when a rich man is upon his death<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bed, and diſpair'd off by Phiſitians, we are wont to ſay: ô if life and health could be bought with money, how glad would this man be? how willingly would he give the halfe of his fortune to free himſelf from preſent death? Yes, life and health may be purchaſed with money: not the fragil and temporal health, but the ſolid and eternal: not this life which is full of miſeries: but the happy life which is a collection of all goods: And inſtead of purchaſing this life, inſtead of redeeming their ſins by alms, inſtead of traficking with this Talent they keep it <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>id and lock'd up in a Coffre, or they throw it away in vani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, ſuperfluities, and debaucheries.</p>
            <p>Another Talent which God deſires us to manage with more care, is the time He gives us to do penance, and other wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kes of holineſs. He deſires ſo much that we make uſe of the preſent time, that he leaves us vncertaine of the future: we know not that after this year, this month, this week, this day, there will be any time for us. Is it not then a great want of prudence, to let it paſs without making good uſe of it? Conſider well your life, ſee in what you em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ploy the precious time? You riſe at eight or nine a clock: you loſe two or three houres in dreſſing your ſelves: you content your ſelves to hear a short maſs: the afternoon is ſpent in giving or receiving viſites: the evening in frivolous diſcourſes, in cardes, or other paſtimes: is this the life of a Chriſtian? is this to bring forth much fruit? is this to be a Purſuer of good Works?</p>
            <p>But that with which we ought to cooperate moſt diligently, is the grace of God: Wherefore. S. Paul cryes-out to us, <hi>receive</hi> 
               <note place="margin">2. <hi>Cor.</hi> 6.</note> 
               <hi>not the grace of God in Vaine.</hi> Nevertheleſs holy Iob notes our abuſe of it: <hi>Ipſi fuerunt rebelles Lumini:</hi> they have been rebells againſt the light. Is it not true that this word is verifyd in you? you <note place="margin">
                  <hi>Iob.</hi> 24. 23.</note> do not ſin through ignorance; you know well that you live not as you ought; you would not dye in the ſtate of negli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence,
<pb n="127" facs="tcp:108789:68"/> Vanity, worldlineſs, in which you are; you do many things which in the houre of death you will wish you had not don; you do not many things which you will wish you had don: you ſeek arguments and apparent reaſons to flatter your ſelves in your imperfections, and abuſes of Gods graces; But We need not to go out of the parable of the Goſpel to confute them. The Maſter ſayd to the ſervant, who had hid his Talent. <hi>naughty ſervant, why have you not put it out to profit?</hi> He had not diſſipated, nor imploy'd ill the Talent: but becauſe he had not gain'd by it, he ſayd to him, <hi>naughty ſervant; take him, and caſt him into exteriour darkneſs.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Let us then apply our ſelves to good workes ſo, that we may ſay with S. Paul <hi>the grace of God hath not been fruitleſs in me;</hi> that <note place="margin">1. <hi>Cor.</hi> 15. 10. <hi>Colloſs</hi> 4. 12. <hi>Apoc.</hi> 3.</note> we may be of the number of thoſe to whome 'tis ſayd, <hi>You ſtand perfect and full in all the Will of God;</hi> that we may not be ſubject to this reproach in the Apocalyps, <hi>I find not thy workes full before God.</hi> Conſider what you would ſay to a workman that should reſt two or rhree houres daily more then he ought; what you would ſay to your farmer, if he should bring you but half the rent he owes you.</p>
            <p>Theſe holy diſpoſitions muſt com from God; it belongs to him to give the beginning, the progreſs, and the accomplish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of our vertue. Beg then theſe graces of him humbly, fervently, and frequently: cooperate with them faithfully: render to him all the glory of your actions: and confeſs that when God shal crown your merits, He will crown his mercies and his favours, Amen.</p>

            <head>DISCOURS XXII. OF NOT DEFERRING GOOD WORKES</head>
            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>Hat which learned <hi>Hypocrates</hi> ſayd in a certain occaſion, we may apply to penance, and the practiſe of other good Workes; <hi>Life is short, Art is long, occaſion flyes away ſwiftly, the experience is dangerous. Life is short:</hi> it is but ſeventy or eighty years: infancy and chilhood cuts off a good part of it: another part is made unpro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fitable by extream old age; ſleep and other neceſſities of the body take up at leaſt a third part of it: all which being deducted, the remainder will be found to be but short. <hi>Art is long:</hi> 'tis a trade full of difficulty, a high and hard enterprize for ſuch as accuſtome themſelves to the wayes of the world, to do penance, and ſatiſfy an infinite Juſtice for many and great ſins, and after that to acquire vertue and perf<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ction. <hi>Occaſion flyes away ſwiftly:</hi> It slides away in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſenſibly, it is bald behind, having eſcaped, it cannot be retaken: when the conveniency to do penance, to acquire perfection is paſt, we shal not recover it again. <hi>The Experiment is dangerous:</hi> for the dignity of a mans body ſayes the Interpreter of <hi>Hypocrates,</hi> and I'le ſay to my purpoſe, for the dignity of the reaſonable ſoul: It is an Experience very dangerous to try whether or no we have don true penance, and practiſed ſolid vertue: there is nothing leſs at ſtake than our ſoul, than our eternal ſalvation; if we experience in the hour of our death, that our penance hath been fals, that our vertues have been wanting or defective, it is an irreparable fault: we com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit it but once, but it is for all Eternity.</p>
            <p>Whence comes it then that we loſe ſo eaſily the fair occaſions which God preſents us to labor in a worke of ſo great conſequence, delaying our converſion to old age, or to the time to com, which perhaps will never be for us.</p>
            <pb n="129" facs="tcp:108789:69"/>
            <p> I deſire to deſtroy utterly ſo penicious an abuſe by three power<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full reaſons. Firſt, that the Converſion which you pretend to make hereafter is uncertaine: Secondly, harder: and thirdly, leſs fruitfull.</p>
            <p n="2">2. It is a maxime in Divinity: that God is abſolute Maſter of his goods, independent in his gifts, and that He gives them as He pleaſes; You ſay you will convert your ſelf hereafter: that nothing preſſes: and you have leaſure enough. Know that you will never do it without a particular favour of God; Know that He owes it not to any: He hath refuſed it to many, and when you delay to leave your evill and negligent life, adding ſin to ſin, you give him cauſe to refuſe it to you alſo. <hi>Conſider the workes of God</hi> 
               <note place="margin">
                  <hi>Amos</hi> 1. 2.</note> ſayes the holy Ghoſt by the mouth of the Wiſe man <hi>and ſee that none can correct whom He hath deſpiſed;</hi> of this Predicament were thoſe of Damaſcus, Tyre, Moab, and others, of whome the Cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ator ſayes <hi>non convertam,</hi> I will not Convert them; of this num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber were the Iewes: to whom the Son of God did ſay, <hi>I go,</hi>

               <hi>and you will ſeek me, and you will die in your ſin.</hi> and thoſe, of whom the Evangeliſt ſayd, that <hi>they could not believe, bécauſe God had blin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded them, and hardned their hearts, that they might not be conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>It is rhen a ſtrange folly: It is to build upon quick ſands: it is to eſtablish a deſigne of the greateſt importance upon an uncertaine event, to defer your converſion to old age, or to fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture time.</p>
            <p>You let the time ſlide away, the occaſions and inſpirations which God gives you to do penance, and advance in piety: who hath aſcertain'd you that<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> He will give you them hereafter?</p>
            <p>You diſpoſe of your ſelf, and make the appointement of your life, as if you were the Maſter of it: you ſpeak of your converſion, as if it depended on you only: you ſay, I will now take my pleaſure content my paſſion, ſatisfy my inclination: afterward I will convert myſelf: will apply my ſelf ſeriouſly to the affaires of my ſalvation; Poor man! you imagin that God will take your meaſures, that He will accommodate himſelf to your little projects, and regulate his thoughts, deſignes, and conduct according to the levell of your rash thoughts: You deceive you ſelf.</p>
            <p>You imagin that you have leaſure enough to convert your ſelf;
<pb n="130" facs="tcp:108789:70"/> But if God call you out of this world ſuddenly, will you convert your ſelf in old age? if you dye in the flower of your age, will you becom vertuous in declining years, if you dye this year, how will you do it?</p>
            <p>The evill ſpirit deals with men, as the Phiſitian or Apothecarie with his Patient: when he ſees the ſick cannot ſwallow a whole pill. he devides it, and makes him ſwallow it by piecemeal; Satan to ſeduce our firſt parents and o make them fall boldly in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to ſin, ſayd to them, <hi>You shal not dye;</hi> at preſent ſeeing it im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſible to perſwade you, that you shal not dye, becauſe you ſee daily the contrary before your eyes: he devides the pill to make you ſwallow it: he ſays to you, you shal not die ſo ſoon: he makes you believe, that you will not die this year: after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward he perſwades you that you will not dye in the following year: nor in the year after that: ſo by little and little he perſwades you what you would not believe in general, that you shal not dye: 'til it happens to you as to our firſt parents, that ſad experience makes you ſee the contrary: when on a ſudden you will be ſurprized, when you think leaſt of it.</p>
            <p n="3">3. But if you should not be ſurprized by ſudden death, and your life should be a hundred years: 'tis a folly to believe that you will convert your ſelf more eaſily in the latter ſeaſon of your age then in the preſent. The word of God tells you ſo ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſly, <hi>Adoleſcens juxta viam ſuam, etiam cum ſenuerit non recedet</hi> 
               <note place="margin">

               <hi>becom vertuous when you are accustomed to vice.</hi> And therefore the holy Ghoſt ſayes by the mouth of Iob of one that had not mortifyd but given himſelf to vices in his youth, <hi>his bones shal be filled with the vices of his youth and shal accompany him to his grave;</hi> for the infirmities of the ſoul, the inclinations and vicious cuſtoms which we quit not in good time, remain commonly with us un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>til old age: now old age being feeble, weak, impotent, not able to do violence to it ſelf, and thinking of little els then of maintaining the short life that reſts, ſeldom purges it ſelf from evill cuſtoms; the old are as much inclin'd to ambition, detraction, anger, as they were at the age of 30 years; ſo that the firſt part of the
<pb n="131" facs="tcp:108789:70"/> maxime of the holy Ghoſt is verifyd in them, that the infirmi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties of their youth have accompanied them to old age; And who doubts, if God do not worke wonderfully in them, and if they do not uſe the greateſt violence upon themſelves, that the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond part will be found as true: that theſe vices will remaine with them 'til death? <hi>Et cum ipſis in pulvere dormient.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>S. Auſtin notes judiciouſly that the Son of God to raiſe Laza<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rus, proceeded otherwiſe than He did to raiſe the daughter of the Prince of the Synagogue; to raiſe this young maid, He took her only by the hand, and ſayd to her, daughter riſe, as if He wakened her out of a ſweet ſleep: to raiſe Lazarus, He troub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led himſelf twice, wept, cry'd-out with a lowd voice, <hi>Lazarus com forth;</hi> this was not that He had more difficulty to raiſe him than the other, ſince He will raiſe all men in the end of the world, <hi>in a moment, in the twinkling of an eye;</hi> But this was <note place="margin">1. <hi>Cor.</hi> 15. 52.</note> to shew that there are ſinners which are with much more diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culty converted than ſome other; He that having fallen through humane frailty makes ſpeedy recourſe to the Son of God, is ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſily revived; but he that is halfe rotten as Lazarus, buried and bound by his ill couſtoms, cover'd with the ſtone of obduration, returns not ſo eaſily to the life of grace: but to this effect there is need of cryes, teares, groanes, great force and violence upon himſelf; ſuch is the ſtrength of bad cuſtomes, and vitious habits: which if not in the beginning rooted out do daily grow ſtronger, increaſe, and becom a ſecond nature. You ſee then that your con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſion deferred to future time, or to old age, is not only very dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous, but alſo much more hard. Let us then proceed and shew, that it will be likewiſe leſs fruitfull.</p>
            <p n="4">4. To convince you of this, let us ſuppoſe you will live to extream old age: and that you will do penance and practiſe ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue about the end of your dayes; this I grant you to convince you: though moſt probably it will never be. But what will you ſay of the Time ſo dear, precious, and important, which you loſe by delaying your converſion? Have you forgotten the counſell of the holy Ghoſt, who ſays to you by the Wiſeman: go to the school of the Ant, diſdain not to learn your leſſon of this little <note place="margin">
                  <hi>Prou</hi> 6.</note> creature: ſee how diligent it is in the ſummer, to make provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſion
<pb n="132" facs="tcp:108789:71"/> for the winter: how it loſes not one moment of time. Have you forgotten this advice of our Savior, <hi>worke whilst it is day, for the night will com in which you can do nothing;</hi> And this <note place="margin">
                  <hi>Iohn.</hi> 9. 4.</note> word of S. Paul: <hi>Let us do good whilſt we have time;</hi> This life, is the time to make proviſion, the proper day to worke, the ſeaſon to merit; All our good actions are the ſeed of eternity: they will produce us eternal ioyes, honors, riches, and delights; Is it not then a great prejudice to loſe ſo great treaſures as you might heap up in the ſpace of many years?</p>
            <p>A noble and learned yong man who lived a little licen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiouſly having written a fine letter in heroick verſe to S. Auſtin, the Saint anſwered him in this manner: <hi>Reading your letter I deſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red to have for ſome hours your poetick veine, to deſcribe in a do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lefull Elegie, the greatneſs of your loſs. God hath indued you with a good underſtanding, with a happy memory, and with much acquired Science: ô great damage to loſe all theſe talents! how much am I diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleaſed to ſee that you loſe them for trifles: If you have found a golden chalice, would you not make á preſent of it to our Savior<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> would you not give it willingly to the Church to be employ'd in his ſervice? God hath given you a golden underſtanding; Why do you not make of it an acceptable ſacrifice to Him?</hi> I ſay the ſame to you; you are in the ſpring of your age, you have a good nature, a lively ſpirit, a ſolid judgment, and a free Will; ô if all this were ſeriouſly conſecrated to God, what glory would He receive thereby? what ſervices might you render Him? what ſoules would you gain to him? what recompences would you find in Heaven? and you loſe all this for the deſire of I know not what: for a little ſenſual pleaſure: for a tye to ſome Creature, for fear to diſpleas I know not whome: through ſlothfulneſs to give your ſelf in good time to God, you bury theſe rich treaſures in a tepide, unprofitable, and idle life: And you reſerve for God but the ſcum of your life, the ruines of your age, the incommodious and uncertain time, your old age, in which you will be able to do little more then to ſay a few prayers ſitting in a chimney corner.</p>
            <p n="5">5, God commanded in the ancient Law that they should offer to Him in Sacrifice, the ſtrongeſt, beſt, and ſoundeſt of the creatures: will He permit that one offer to him the
<pb n="133" facs="tcp:108789:71"/> moſt weak, feeble, and unprofitable age of man? He that ordered the firſt fruits of the earth should be offered to Him, and otherwiſe bleſſed not the reſt: does He not exact that a man should offer to him the firſt fruits of his life? will He bleſs the old age of him, who denyed him his youth? Remember ô man that your life is the poſſeſſion and the inheritance of God: if your farmer brings you for ren<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

And of your life which is the inheritance of God, you give to the Divell the good corne, the fine flower, the pure liquour, to wit your younger and better years, and you re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve for God but Ry, ſtraw, dregs and lees, which is your old age. Are you not asham'd to reſerve for the exerciſe of ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue but the time of old age? Is it time to begin to live well, when you are ready to dye? and to lay the foundations of your eternal happineſs in that age, to which ſo few do live?</p>

            <p n="2">2. This word penance coms from the word pain, and this word pain, is derived from the latine word <hi>pone,</hi> behind, becauſe pain does always follow ſin; If we offend God and imagin to eſcape unpunished, we imagin a thing that never hath been, and never will be, a thing impoſſible.

Paul tells you, that when you shal think that you enioy a profound peace, and are ſure to live, then a ſudden death shal ſurprize you; the examples of ſo many that die ſuddenly or before they expected, admonish you to lay hold on the preſent time; ſay not then we have time enough: that nothing preſſes to do penance; It is quite contrary; There is nothing that does not urge and preſs<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> What is it that urges and Preſſeſs, you to penance?
<pb n="137" facs="tcp:108789:73"/>
'Tis the Will of God who commands you by S. Iohn Baptiſt, by the Apoſtles, by the holy Doctors, by the Councells of the Church, and by the mouth of his own Son. What is that which urges you? 'Tis the fear you ought to have to offend the greatneſs of God, his infinite juſtice, his Immenſity, and moſt adorable Preſence. What is that which urges you? The fear of falling into new ſins, of dying in an ill ſtate, of loſing the merit of your good Workes: It is the example of the Saints, who have don Penance all their life; It is the charity of IESUS, who incarnated himſelf, who endured ſo much, Who dyed upon the Croſs to oblige you to it: who hath expected you ſo long, and ſo patiently with this intention; who promiſes you pardon and to receive you, if you do true Penance.</p>
            <p>See then the changes which true penance makes, that you may not ſo eaſily be deceived in a matter of ſo great impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance. The Prophet Ioöl expreſſes them in a few words: <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vert to me in all your heart, in faſting, and in weeping, and</hi>

            <p n="5">5. In the firſt place, true penance changes and converts us: <hi>Convert;</hi> It is an admirable Chimiſtrie which transforms not me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>talls, but ſouls; ir changes not peuter into ſilver, copper into gold: but men into Angells: from carnal, terreſtrial, vitious and brutal, it turns them into ſpiritual, vertuous, and divine men. S. Paul calls him that is converted, <hi>a new creature, a new man,</hi> and he ſays that by penance we are renew'd and reform'd, becaus we deveſt our ſelves of the old Adam, for to reveſt our ſelves with the new, which is IESUS-CHRIST.</p>

You will find ſometims Penitents, whom the Confeſſor asking: Are you well prepar'd to confeſſion? They will anſwer readily, yes Sir; we have made an act of contrition; And how have they made it? They have read in a book a prayer or forme of contrition: <hi>my God it repents me from the bottome of my heart to have committed Sin, becaus it diſpleaſes you; I am ſorry to have offended you becaus you are infinitely good;</hi> and becaus they have ſayd theſe, or the like words in their underſtanding, or with their mouth, they thinke that they have made an Act of contrition. 'Tis well don to ſay theſe words, provided you ſay true; But to thinke you have made an Act of Contrition, by ſaying them with your mouth, or in your underſtanding, is a moſt perni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious error; For Contrition is not in the lipps, nor in the imagination, nor in the underſtanding, but in the Will. God re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quires not that you ſay, you are ſorry to have offended him, but He wills that you be ſo in effect; a man that harbours ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſities in his heart, or that reſtores not goods unjuſtly gotten, may ſay a hundred times <hi>my God I am Sorry to have offended you,</hi> and yet he will not have one grain of true repentance. By what may one know that he has it? by the effects: if you make reſtitution; if you leave off this unjuſt ſuit and repair damages; if you fly this occaſion of ſin: you ſhew probably that your heart is chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged. But if you content your ſelf with words or imaginations. one will ſay to you, that you give to God the motion of your lipps: But the affection of your heart is far from Him<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>

            <p n="8">8. Others change theyr lives, and their hearts notwithſtanding are not changed; the change is made about them, not in them; they were heretofore frequenters of naughty houſes, and of ill
<pb n="139" facs="tcp:108789:74"/> companies? Now they are ruined in their fortune, health, and reputation by their diſſolutions; Wherefore they go no more to thoſe houſes, into thoſe companies, they make no more exceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes, they play no more: becaus they have not wherewith to to defray the charges, or their health will not permit them; it is their purſes, or their bodies that are changed, not perhaps their hearts. I know not what confeſſions ſuch do make: theyr bodys and their tongues ceaſe to commit the ſin: But their he<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>arts perhaps ceaſe not to love it; and if God hath not the heart, He makes little or no account of all the reſt; He loves ſo much the heart, that He will have it all.</p>
            <p n="9">9. He ſays by his Prophet, <hi>Convert your ſelves to me with all</hi>

            <p n="10">10. The fourth converſion that true penance makes is of our exteriour: it makes us to do exteriour workes of penance when theſe are in our power. The Prophet ſayd not only, <hi>convert in your heart,</hi> but moreover <hi>in faſting, and weeping, and in mour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning.</hi> And S. Iohn Baptiſt required exterior workes of penance when he ſayd, <hi>yield fruits worthy of penance;</hi> And our Saviour ſais not only, that a good tree bears not bad fruit, but he adds, that it produces good, and that it is by this, that we muſt know it to be good; if your penance be not of this ſtamp, it is ſteril as the figtree neer Bethania, and is likewiſe curſed by our Savior.</p>
            <p n="11">11. If you aske S. Paul, what are the fruits that this good tree of penance ought to beare? He anſwers writing to
<pb n="140" facs="tcp:108789:75"/> the Corinthians, that it is a great care of our ſalvation, a holy indignation againſt Sin, a fear and apprehenſion of Gods juge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, <note place="margin">2. <hi>Cor.</hi> 7. 11.</note> a great deſire to be pleaſing to him, an ardent zeal of his glory, a ſpirit of vengeance to punish in our ſelves the offence of God.</p>
            <p>If you demand of S. Chriſoſtome, what are theſe fruits? He anſwers, that they are the practiſes of vertues wholy contrary to the crimes you have committed: for example, you have uſurped <note place="margin">

You have wallowed in the mire of ſenſual pleaſures, deprive your ſelf of the delights which are not forbidden. You have offended your neighbour by word or worke, render good for evill to them that diſoblige you. You have been given to exceſſes, and to drunkenneſs, addict your ſelf to abſtinence, and faſting.</p>
            <p>If you aske S. Pacian, what are the fruits worthy of penance? <note place="margin">
                  <hi>Epiſt.</hi> 31.</note> He anſwers, that they are mortifications of of the flesh, retrench<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of pleaſures, privations of temporal goods diſtributed to the Poor, and the labours of life.</p>
            <p n="12">12. This penance cannot be a worke of a man: it muſt be an effect of Gods mercy; wherefore beg it of him, affectionately; ſay often <hi>vouchſafe to bring us to true penance.</hi> He diſpoſes us and brings us to it ſometimes by alms; give as many as you can, either corporal, or ſpiritual: <hi>Redeem your ſins with alms</hi> ſayd the Prophet Daniel. He <note place="margin">
                  <hi>Dan.</hi> 4. 24.</note> leads us to it by mortifications: for as exteriour humiliation is the way to interiour humility, ſays S. Bernard, ſo auſterities, and exteriour penances, are diſpoſitions to interiour compun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction. He brings us to penance by the interceſſion of the Saints, and by the examples of their vertues; implore their aide devout ly: have in your houſes the hiſtory of their lives, read it, and make it to be read to your families: excite your ſelves to penance by the conſideration of their auſterities; if you have perfectly this ſecond, Baptiſme, it will reſtore you to the inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cency of the firſt; if you have this shield you will ſave your ſelves from the anger of God; if you have this planck, it will carry you to a good haven, to the haven of eternal felicity.

            <head>DISCOURS XXIV. OF PRAYER.</head>
            <p n="1">1. <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg>ESUS-CHRIST being the Idea, Mirrour, and the Model of the Elect, He inſtructs them by his Example in all which they ought to do to obtain ſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation: He ſays to them, <hi>Exemplum dedi vobis,</hi> I have given you example; And becaus Prayer is one of the moſt profitable, important, and neceſſary actions in a Chriſtian life, He would give moſt authentike, and remarkable examples <note place="margin">

               </note> of it. This is the reaſon, as S. Auſtin notes, why He pray ed often with a lowd voice; if He had pryed only to obtain graces for his Church, it would have been enough to have prayed interiourly, in ſecret, or with a low voice; But being our Advocate He remembred that He was alſo our Doctor, and the prayer which He made for us, He pronunced before us, that He might profit us, not only by impe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tration of graces for us, but alſo by giving us a model. Whence it follows, that to be heard in our prayers, we ought not to aske any thing, but what IESUS hath asked; He never demanded nor will He ever demand for his, the Glory of the world, the riches of the earth, or delights of the flesh; we ought then to aske of God, as his members, and by his merits, love, fear, grace, conduct, vertues, and temporalls preciſely neceſſary: and we ought to ask them ſo, as He asked them. His Apoſtle teaches us, that his prayer was always accompanied with <note place="margin">
                  <hi>Heb.</hi> 5.</note> three circumſtances, wherewith ours ought alſo to be ſeaſoned; <hi>During the cours of his life He offered prayers and ſupplications to God with teares and great Cry, and He was heard for his Reverence;</hi> firſt then we ought to pray with Humility; ſecondly, with Fer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour; thirdly, with Perſeverance. <hi>For his Reverence:</hi> there is Humility; <hi>with teares and great cry:</hi> there is fervour; <hi>During</hi>

               <hi>the cours of his life;</hi> there is Perſeverance.</p>
            <p n="2">2. We ought to pray with humility and with interior and exte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rior Reverence. The interior conſiſts in a profound abaſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment and annihilation of our ſelves in the preſence of God; we ought to eſteem much, and apprehend lively the greatneſs of his Majeſty, the excellence of his Being, and the infinity of his Perfections, our lowneſs, littleneſs, and infirmity: to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledg and avow that we are more then moſt unworthy, not only to convers with him, or to ſpeak to h<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>m, but alſo to appear in his preſence; we muſt go to Him as a poor begget to a rich man, for an Alms: as a ſickman to a Phiſitian, to be cured: as a criminal to a judg, to implore favour and pardon; and ſay with great S. Auſtin, you are infinitely mercifull, I am extreamly miſerable: you are the true Phiſitian, I am ſick to death: you are an Abyſs of all good, I poor and in want of all things. We muſt go to him with a lively ſenſe of the extream need we have of his aſſiſtance, and of the ſeverei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gn independency He hath of all without himſelf: believing firm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, that all the ſervice we can do him, all the homages and praiſes of the higheſt Seraphins add not one grain to his eſſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tial Beatitude and glory.</p>
            <p n="3">3. From this interior diſpoſition proceeds the exterior reveren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ce, by which we proſtrate on the ground before God, or we kneel, and if we cannot, we hold our ſelves in an humble, modeſt<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and reſpectfull poſture.

The valiant Iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dith to obtain ſucceſs in her generous enterprize, proſtrated in her oratory, clothed her body with a hairshirt, and cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>r'd her head with ashes; And what is more conſiderable, our Saviour himſelf, when He prayed in the garden, fell upon his face. Whereupon S. Ceſer Bishop of Arles complaining ſays,
<pb n="143" facs="tcp:108789:76"/> Mercy proſtrats himſelf, and Miſery does not: Sanctity humbles himſelf, and iniquity will not: Innocence inclines, and malice will not bow; the Iudg lies upon the ground, and the criminal reſts himſelf indecently.</p>
            <p n="4">4. 'Tis true, God is a Spirit, and He demands chiefly of us humility of ſpirit and affection of heart; But we are compoſed of body and ſoul: we receiv'd both from him: and we ought to employ both in his ſervice. When we kneel reverently, bow, or proſtrate humbly before God, we teſtify his greatneſs and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellence: our lowneſs, indignity, and vility: that the burden of our ſins oppreſs us, and that we com to God to be eaſed: and theſe humble poſtures excite our interior humility and devotion, they diſpoſe us to receive the dew of heaven more abundant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, and the grant of our requeſts; one reaſon why the man-God was heard of his Father was, that He prayed with great humility of ſpirit, with a profound reverence, and proſtration of body: <hi>He was heard for his reverence,</hi> ſays S. Paul</p>
            <p n="5">5. He pray'd in the ſecond place, <hi>with teares and a ſtrong cry;</hi> to shew the fervour of his ſpirit, and to teſtify the aſpirations of his heart; we may note, that very frequently, if not as of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten as 'tis ſayd, any one hath cryed-out in prayer to God, the ſacred text does add, that he was hear'd: and God pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes it expreſſly: <hi>He shal cry out to me, and I will heare him;</hi> What is it to cryout to God in prayer? Is it to raiſe the <note place="margin">
                  <hi>Pſal.</hi> 90.</note> Voice? No: for Moſes moved not his lipps, and God ſayd to him: <hi>you cry-out to me;</hi> When you pray, an ardent deſire is a great cry in the eares of God ſayd S. Bérnard.</p>
            <p n="6">6. Why thinke you God deferrs a long time the grant of our requeſts, alſo when we aske vertues and ſpiritual favours? It is ſays S. Auſtin to increaſe and inflame our deſire: that we may learn to eſteem much, and to have a great deſire of great <note place="margin">

               </note> things, We are accuſtomed to ſay that a thing is little worth, that is not worth the asking; It is then worth the asking ſo much the more fervently, how much it is more noble and more precious; and what is more pretious then the love of God, his grace, and the Salvation of our ſoules? when we pray coldly or tepidly, we make no great account of the graces
<pb n="144" facs="tcp:108789:77"/> that we aske: if we make no great account of them, we ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der our ſelves unworthy of them.</p>
            <p n="7">7. The reaſon why we pray negligently, and that we have not a great deſire to be heard, is that we ponder not the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tream need we have of Gods mercy: we conſider this affair as a thing indifferent, or of little conſequence; We ought to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve firmly, that if God hath not pity on us, we shal be moſt miſerable and unhapy creatures; we know not that God hath pardoned the ſins of our youth: that we have had a ſuper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>natural and legitimate repentance of them; and if we should know this: we know not what will becom of us; for we are more fragil than glaſs, more weak then reeds, and more unconſtant then the winds: what will then beco<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>m of us, if God hath not pity on us.</p>
            <p n="7">7. He that knows not how to pray, let him go to ſea, and ſee how they pray in a great ſtrom, and in danger of death: and let him pray ſo always, and He will be ſaved infallibly. We are in a greater danger of damnation, then they are of death; they are not ſo endanger'd, but by two or three winds: we are by more then ſix: by pride, avarice, envy luxury, and other paſſions; betwixt them and death there is but a planke: betwixt me and hell, there is but my will, which is more fra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gil than that planke; if that planke were left alone, it would laſt a longtime: but if my will were left to it ſelf but a little while, it would fall into horrible precipices, and loſe it ſelf; we are more uncapable to govern our ſelves and obtain ſalvation without a particular grace of God, than a man who hath never-been at ſea, is to govern a ship in a tempeſt in the midſt of rocks and ſands; Now I make your ſelves judges, if we ought not to pray with all the force of our hearts?</p>
            <p n="8">8. But let us not go to ſea: let us ſtay on land: there is no need to go ſo far to learn to pray; I find here a great number of excellent Teachers: but I am a bad ſcholler and learn not my leſſon well: theſe are the poor that ask alms; they givê us, not thin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king of it, fine inſtructions, if we reflect upon them<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> If they know where early in the morning is a great concours of peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, they riſe not flowly, but haſten to the place; Riſe you ſo
<pb n="145" facs="tcp:108789:77"/> early, to have opportunity to pray half an houre or an houre: the Spirit is then more fresh, leſs incombred with affaires, and more vigorous to pray. They range about the ſtreets and Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches where they know are rich and charitable perſons; make you recours to the friends of God, to the Saints who are rich in merits, and powerfull with the Son of God; The Poor diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cover their wounds, they shew their ulcers, and half rotten mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers: and if they have none, they counterfeit ſome, to move men to compaſſion; we have no need to counterfeit: we have but too many in our ſouls: we muſt acknowledg them in the preſence of God, and expoſe them to the Compaſſionat aſpects of his mercy, and ſay: my God! you ſee I am but darkneſs, weakneſs, pover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, and miſery: I have nothing of my ſelf, but ignorance and ſin.</p>
            <p>Though many of theſe Poor are Idiots and ignorant: yet they find words, reaſons, and arguments to move us to compaſſion, to perſwade us to mercy, and to draw from us an Alms; Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dame have pity on me: beſtow one penny upon me, you will not be the poorer, and I will pray for you. I am a poor or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phan, a ſtranger and far from my friends and country, where I was ruined by fire; shew your charity to me, I ask it for the love of God. for the Paſſion of our Saviour. why find they ſo many words to beg an alms, and we find them not to pray God? It is becaus they have a great deſire to receive an alms from men: and we deſire but little to receive one that is more ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary from God. Tis neceſſary that the feeling of our wants do ſuggeſt to us words; and one half houre of prayer made with ſuch a feeling wil be better then three houres of prayer without it.</p>
            <p n="9">9.

            <p>S.

And the ſame holy Father writing to Marcella tels her the Ember dayes as well as the Lent were inſtituted by the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles.</p>

               </gap>l not thinke the precept of faſting too ſevere, if you conſider the reaſons which moved the Apoſtles to inſtitute the Lent. It was firſt to commemorate and honor the retreat and the penance of our Saviour in the deſert: to honor it, I <note place="margin">
                  <hi>Rom.</hi> 8. 26.</note> ſay, by imitation, according to our power; For S. Paul ſays,
<pb n="150" facs="tcp:108789:80"/> his ſervants muſt follow and imitate him, to be one day with him. In what muſt they follow and imitate him? Not in prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching, and in working miracles: but in faſting or ſuffering for the love of him; his Apoſtle declares it in theſe ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſs words: <hi>Let us shew, that we are the Miniſters or ſervants of God by our faſts, our watchings, our labors, and other practiſes of</hi>

            <p>In the ſecond place the Lent was inſtituted for the converſion of ſouls; to purify our conſciences from the ordure of ſin by the practiſe of penance: and by this ſanctification to diſpoſe us to receive worthily the Euchariſt. For the Prophet Ioel ſays, faſting conduces much to a true converſion: that it is one of the parts of penance <hi>convert your ſelves to me in faſting.</hi>

            </p>
            <p>The Lent is moreover faſted, to make the anniverſary funerall of our Saviours death; But ſorrow and funeralls are incompatible with good cheer: for the holy Ghoſt diſtinguishes and oppoſes them to one another:: <hi>It is better,</hi> ſays He, <hi>to go to the houſe of mourning, then to the houſe of banqueting.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="4">4. S. Paul tels us that many have their Belly for their God; for this reaſon they are very eloquent and zealous to plead its cauſe: they fight for their God with many arguments; With ſome they would shew faſting to be ſuperfluous or ſuperſtitious: with others, hurtfull or pernicious. If you are predeſtinated, will you not be ſaved ſay they, without your faſting? do you thinke God did expect your faſting to predeſtinate you? Anſwer, God did not expect our faſts, but He foreſaw them and other good workes, for which He predeſtinated us to glory: or this He did predeſtinate, and this He does decree: that by theſe means we shal obtaine that end: not otherwiſe.</p>
            <p>CHRIST faſted for you to deliver uou from this labor; Why do you then afflict your ſelves in vain by faſting, as if Chriſts faſt did not ſuffice for your ſalvation, without your little faſts?

Have you not read in the Pſalmiſt, <hi>I will Sacrifice to you voluntarily?</hi> Anſwer: a faſt com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded by the Church is better than that we take up by our own election; for this proceeds out of one vertue, to wit Temperance: that from two, Temperance and Obedience: And if a comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded faſt should proceed from obedience obly: yet it would be ſo much better, and more Excellent than the other, how much the ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue of obedience is better than that of Temperance: <hi>Obedience is</hi>

            <p n="5">5. The Epicurians, and the Advocats of ſelf love urge, as they imagin, yet more forcibly: and to juſtify themſelves make this remonſtrance; We muſt love our bodys as well as our ſouls for God created both, and loves both, and wills that we do love them: But faſting and other auſterities hinder ſleep, punish the body and weaken it: prejudice health, and shorten life: and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequently by faſts and other auſterities, we act againſt the will of God, the law of nature, and are injurious to our ſelves.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſwer a fool according to his folly, leſt he ſeem to himſelf wiſe,</hi> God Would have us to love our Body; True: but He wills us to love it truly; and to love it truly, is to procure it, by the means of faſting, prayer, and other exerciſes of vertue, true, perfect, and everlaſting health. What does it profit the flesh. that You nourish it delicately, if you nourish it for hell? If you feed it ſo, that it becoms the fuel of eternal fire? would you not love it better if you curb it, and afflict it here a little with hunger and with thirſt, to have it ſound and glorious for all Eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity? This is that which our Saviour ſays, <hi>Qui amat animam ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>am perdet eam: et qui odit in hoc mundo animam ſuam, in vitam E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternam</hi> 
               <note place="margin">1. <hi>Iohn.</hi> 12.</note> 
               <hi>cuſtodit eam;</hi> He that loves this temporal life, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore permits not his flesh to be moleſted, nor afflicts it with faſting watching, and other vertuous labors, does not keep it to everlaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting life.</p>
            <pb n="152" facs="tcp:108789:81"/>
            <p> Faſting hinders ſleep: I believe it: and it was alſo inſtituted to hinder too much ſleep: that ſo you may have more time for prayer, ſpiritual reading, and other exerciſes of a Chriſtian.</p>
            <p>Faſting punishes and afflicts the body; I doubt not of it, if well practi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed; And do you thinke it was inſtituted for other purpoſe than to punish it; you will not then go to heaven if the way be not eaſy and pleaſing to the flesh? if it be not ſtrew'd with flowers and ſweet herbs? And where then is the law of chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aniſme, which is a law of mortification and of the Croſs? And what will becom of theſe words of our Saviour: <hi>Strive to enter by the narrow gate?</hi> You ſay faſting does prejudice health and shorten life; The Church, the Canon law, good Phiſitians, and experience <note place="margin">
                  <hi>Quicqd Etc. legi<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>mus de Conſecra. diſt.</hi> 5.</note> ſay quite the contrary; the Church in the Collect of the firſt ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turday in lent ſays, this ſolemn faſt was holily inſtituted for the health both of ſoul and body. And in the Decretalls of Gratian we read, that many who had infirmities, their goods being confis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cated, and they reduced to poverty, ſo that they could not ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ke good cheer, were cured by this forced dyet. All good Phiſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tians will tell you, that for one hurt by faſting, fifty are killed by eating and drinking: And Experience shews that the more ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtemious uſually enjoy better health, and longer life.</p>
            <p>It is true, that Faſting macerates and weakens bodys that are not well accuſtomed and hardned by it: But it ſtrengthens ſouls and makes them reign: they are diſpoſed by it to prayer and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>templation: they pleaſe God by it, ſatisfy his juſtice, merit and impetrate of Him Benefits, temporal and eternal: The ſervant body then muſt indure theſes paines and labours. by which accrew ſo many, and ſo great advantages to the lady ſoul nor does the Soul do injury to the body making it to faſt, but much obliges it; She exempts it from punishments which it merited by rebel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lions; for nothing appeaſes more the anger of God, nothing averts better the thunderbolts of his juſtice then faſting and other macerations of the body, which proceed out of true converſion and compunction of heart: Witneſs the Ninivites.</p>
            <p>It is doplorable<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> that they who glory in the name of Chriſtians have not ſo much ſight and judgment, as thoſe poor Pagans; the Son of God hath reaſon to ſay, that they shal riſe in judgment and
<pb n="153" facs="tcp:108789:81"/> condemn them; Ionas ſayd not to the Ninivites, faſt, put on hair-cloth, do pennance, but only <hi>fourty days and Ninive shal be ſubverted:</hi> and yet Pagans as they were, had the light to know, that to appeaſe God, it was neceſſary to faſt, and to do penance; they published a faſt ſo general and ſevere, that all from the greateſt to the leaſt, from the eldeſt to the youngeſt, alſo bruit beaſts, faſted three days and nights without any meat or drink: Should the Church command ſuch a faſt, how would they cry-out againſt her? but he Creatour approv'd this Edict, and pardoned the ſins of thoſe that had ſo faſted.</p>
            <p n="6">6. To be short: if auſterities be unlawfull and forbidden: we muſt condemn all the ancient Anchorets, and a great part of the primitive Chriſtians who faſted almoſt daily in bread and water, through the Spirit of penance and mortification; we muſt con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demn the Religious of the preſent Church, who weaken their bodys by the exerciſes of penance; We muſt condemn our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vior who faſted, and ſpent whole nights in prayer upon mount olivet, to give us example; we muſt condemn the holy Ghoſt. who exhorts us by the Apoſtle earneſtly, <hi>to shew that we are the Miniſters or ſervants of God, by Patience, by Watchings:</hi>

            <head>DISCOURS XXVI. OF ALMS.</head>
            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">B</seg>Leſſed is the man that conſiders the neceſſities of the poor to have pity on him, God will treat him ſweetly and mildly in the day of jud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gement, <note place="margin">Pſal.</note> in the day which the Royal Prophet cals the evill day. The Sentence of the Iudg will be favourable to him: He will ſay to him with an Encomium, I have been hungrie, and you have given me meat, ad that it may prove ſo, He forewarns and ſays to us: <hi>make your ſelves friends,</hi> give alms, do good to the Poore<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> that they, and the alms which you put into their boſomes may plead and intercede for you, Let us then conſider, who muſt give alms? To whom they muſt be given? and how men ought to give them?</p>
            <p n="1">1. Who is he that muſt give Alms? All Chriſtians that pretend to obtaine one day the kingdom of Heaven. we need no other proof then the word of IESUS, and the definitive ſenten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ce which He will pronounce in favour of the elect, and againſt the reprobate: <hi>Com ye bleſsed of. my Father, poſſeſs the kingdom; for you have given, Get ye gon from me ye curſed into everlaſting fire</hi>
               <pb n="156" facs="tcp:108789:83"/> 
               <hi>for you have not given;</hi> All either are ſaved for giving, or damned for not giving alms: every one then is obliged to give them. And in the ſame chapter He compares the whole Church to an aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſembly of Virgins, whereof ſome are admitted to a nuptial feaſt for having furnished their lamps with oyle: the others are ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded, for having none.</p>
            <p n="9">9. Hence S. Chryſoſtome concludes, if thoſe that were Virgins, <note place="margin">
                  <hi>Hom.</hi> 22. <hi>in Io.</hi>
               </note> that is to ſay, that had no other great ſins, were banished from heaven, for not giving alms with more reaſon thoſe who have committed ſins, and have not redeemed them by alms, shal be condemn'd. He adds, let us have then this oyle of mercy, if we will enter with the Eſpouſe: for what ever we shal do, tis im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſible without alms, I ſay again, 'tis impoſſible to approach to the door of the Kingdom of heaven.</p>
            <p n="2">2 Can we be ſaved without Charity, without loving God, and being beloved of God? no ſurely; Now his beloved Diſciple ſays: <hi>If any one having the goods of this world, and ſeeing his brother in</hi> 
               <note place="margin">1. <hi>Iohn.</hi> 3. 17.</note> 
               <hi>neceſſity shuts up his bowells of charity from him, how does the Love of God remain in him?</hi> He ſays not ſeeing his brother in extream neceſſity, but ſimply in neceſſity; Tis then an error to believe, the commandement of giving alms obliges not, but when our neig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bor is in extream neceſſity; Yes it obliges when he is in a great and notable poverty, as are ſo many in theſe deplorable times; For as Vaſquez reaſons very well, the precept of charity obliges all, as well poor as rich to ſuccour their neigbor when he is in extrem neceſſity: nature it ſelf teaches it, without other poſitive command; and 'tis principally to the rich that the holy Scripture makes this commandement of alms; Tis not then only in extream neceſſity the rich are oblig'd to give: but alſo in a conſiderable and important need <hi>command the rich of this</hi> 
               <note place="margin">1. <hi>Tim. c.</hi> 17. 1. <hi>Cor.</hi> 22. 26.</note> 
               <hi>world to give eaſily</hi> ſays S. Paul. And he gives in another place the reaſon of it: we are parts and members of the Myſtical Body of IESUS; But when one member hath receiv'd any hurt, all the other ſuffer with it, all contribute to the help of it; if a thorn hath entred into the foot, the back bends, the eyes open and ſeek it, the hand pulls it out: and if they should do otherwiſe, it would be irregular, monſtrous and unnatural: with much
<pb n="157" facs="tcp:108789:83"/> more reaſon in the body of the Church, which hath JESUS for its head, and the holy Ghoſt for its ſoul, the members are oblig'd to ſolace and ſerve each other with a ſincere and cordial charity.</p>
            <p>S. Peter Confirms the ſaying of S. Paul, and adds another reaſon: that we are not independent Proprietors and Maſters of the riches, <note place="margin">
                  <hi>Epiſt.</hi> 1. <hi>c.</hi> 4. 10.</note> talents, gifts, and graces which we receiv'd from God: He obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges us to be good Economiſts and Diſpenſers of them: to aſſiſt and ſerve the neceſſities of our neighbors with them: if then we employ them not, but only keep them, we do againſt the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention of the Maſter that lends them: and on the contrary, if we employ them in diſſolutions, and other Superfluities, we do contrary to the will of him who intruſts us with them. If an Economiſt of a great houſe should reſerve to himſelf all the bread and wine, and other proviſions; and refuſe to give them to the children, and ſervants, according to the order of his Maſter, would he not merit to be punished? if on the contrary, he dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tributes them faithfully, would he not gaine the ſalary promiſed to him? The power and authority you have, God hath given you to protect this Widow, and this Orphan that are oppreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed: the underſtanding, Science, induſtry which are in you, you receiv'd from God, to aſſiſt and inſtruct the ignorant: and theſe goods you poſſeſs, God made you the ſteward of them to Communicate them to the Poor, after you have had the honor and the prerogative to take of them what is neceſſary for your perſon, and your family; if you do not He will ſay to you. as to the naughty ſervant in the Goſpell: <hi>Why have you not employ'd well my money?</hi> If you do as you ought, He will ſay to you: <hi>Com faithfull Servant enter into the joy of thy</hi>

                  <hi>Matth.</hi> 5.</note> 
               <hi>Lord.</hi> Let us ſee then to whom we ought to give.</p>
            <p n="3">3. Charity obliges us to give to all that are in neceſſity, but eſpecially to the faithfull: to others, we muſt give alms as to the creatures, and the images of God: but to the faithfull moreover, as to the members of IESUS CHRIST, and for the love of Him, and ſo to IESUS CHRIST in them; for He will ſay in iudgment, <hi>I have been hungrie: I have been thurs<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty: I have been ſick;</hi> IESUS then is ſick, and ſuffers in his
<pb n="158" facs="tcp:108789:84"/> members: and IESUS receives our help and aſſiſtance in them; if we beſtow our alms ſo, our charity will be more accepta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to him, and more meritorious to us, than if we did give them to his own perſon. if you had lived in that golden age when IESUS was viſible to the world: would you not have been ravished with joy to have lodged Him, ſerved, and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertain'd. Him? you merit more if you do it to a poor man ſays S. Chryſoſtom, for the charmes of his pleaſing Countenance and his Comportment would allure your hearts, and force them by a ſweet attraction to will him good; but when you do it to him in the perſon of the Poor, who are ſo diſagreable: your faith is more lively: your charity more generous, and your pie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty more diſintereſſed, ſince ſelf love finds not there her reck<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning.</p>
            <p>It ſeems IESUS should ſay in the laſt iugdment to S. Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thew, you made me a banket in your Converſion: to Zacheus you receiv'd me into your houſe: to S. Martha you log'd me in your Caſtle, you ſerv'd me with great diligence. No, He will not praiſe them principally for theſe good offices: But He will ſay to them. <hi>That which you have don to the leaſt of mine, you have don to me:</hi> becaus He eſteems more that which is don to his members, than what is don to himſelf; let us weigh theſe words.</p>
            <p n="4">4. Firſt He ſays: <hi>That which you have don to the leaſt of mine;</hi> He means chiefly; the poor, ſince He ſpeakes of thoſe that <note place="margin">
                  <hi>Matth</hi> 52. 40.</note> hunger and thirſt; Tis then a ſtrang folly, which diſpleaſes him extreamly, to give your goods to flatterers, to diſſolute per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons, or to employ them to enrich your children, to elevate or greaten your parents, or to leave them wherewith to live in dilights, in diſſolutions, whilſt our Saviour hath not where with to live in the perſon of the poor? is not this a great injuſtice to give to your child wherewith to live in ſuperfluity and not to give to our Saviour, wherewith to ſuſtaine. a poor life ſays S. Austin? He ſays, <hi>Wherewith to live in ſuperfluity;</hi> for you may merit, if out of the ſpirit of charity and mercy you leave to your children, or to your parents, as to the mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers of JESUS CHRIST, goods as alms, wherewith to maintaine themſelves according to their quality, in Chriſtian
<pb n="159" facs="tcp:108789:84"/> modeſty and frugality: not in ſuperfluity, and in the ambition of the world.</p>
            <p n="5">5. <hi>You have don to me,</hi> for the love of me, if you give alms out of natural compaſſion, 'tis not chriſtian charity, but moral vertue; if our of oſtentation, to be eſteemed liberal: 'tis vanity; if becaus the poor man is of the ſame countrey profeſſion or condition that you are, that he is a Soldier, and you have been: that he hath been a marchant, and you are; 'tis to give an alms to a man, to a ſoldier, to a marchant, and not to JESUS, and becaus the poor man is his member, Diſciple, or his Brother; likewiſe if you give it to the end only that God may recompence you by temporal goods: JESUS will not ſay to you, <hi>you have given to me;</hi> becaus in effect 'tis not for IESUS that you give it, but for your ſelves: 'tis not alms but ava<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rice.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>You have don to me;</hi> He ſays not to my ſervants, my faithfull, but to me: we muſt then conſider IESUS in the poor, and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port our ſelves towards them, with the ſame diſpoſitions, that we would to IESUS: and ſeaſon our alms with all that is requiſite to a moſt vertuous and meritorious action.</p>
            <p n="6">6. Firſt beſtow your alms with tenderneſs, commiſeration, and with bowells of compaſſion; for mercy ought to make our hearts miſerable by a ſympathy of charity, participating in the ſuffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rances, and afflictions of others.</p>
            <p n="7">7. Secondly with benignity, ſweetneſs and affability, the te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtimony of affection and benevolence; and abſtaine from all re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proaches, which would make a poor man ſuffer more by the confuſion to which you put him, than you pleaſure him by the alms you give him.</p>
            <p n="8">8. In the third place, with interiour humility, thinking that you are not worthy to give an alms to IESUS; and in effect, all that we do is nothing in compariſon of that we should do: and what we give leſs than our lives, is leſs than that which in occaſion we ought to give, for <hi>God hath given his life for us, and we ought to give alſo our lives for our</hi>

            <p n="9">9. In fine, give prompty, ioyfully, and copiouſly: let your

            <p n="10">10i. Let us conclude with the fine words of S. Auguſtine: <hi>Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, exerciſe mercy, there is no other band to tye us to the love of</hi>

               <hi>God and of our neighbor: there is no other means to carry us from earth to heaven;</hi> and a little after he adds, <hi>Behold what you may buy: how much you muſt give for it: and when you muſt buy it?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Behold what you muſt buy! Paradiſe is to be ſold: you may buy with money the kingdom of heaven, eternal life, and the poſſeſſion of God; What great favour! what incomparable happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs! if God did not permit it, who would dare ſo much as to thinke of it? ô if men be damn'd, they deſerve not to be pitied! Satan will have good reaſon to laugh at them, and ſay; ô great fools they would give willingly the half of their goods to buy 30. or 40. years of life, and of a life full of afflictions, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmities and miſeries: and they would not give it to buy millions of years of a moſt happy and delicious life. And do not tell me. ſo precious marchandiſe is not ſold at a cheap rate, and that you have neither gold, nor ſilver, nor means to buy it.</p>
            <p>Bohold how much you muſt give for it: a glaſs of cold wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, a little ſervice if you have nothing els, may procure you it. our Saviour ſpeaking to his poor Apoſtles ſayd: you have always poor with you, and you may do good to them when you pleaſe: He ſays not, you may give to them; But you may do good to them; becaus many cannot give: but every one can do good. You may viſet the ſick, and impriſoned, and though you have nothing to give: you may comfort them, exhort them, and do them other ſervices: The Son of God will not ſay, you have not redeem'd me out of priſon: but you have not viſited me that you may have no excuſe.</p>
            <p>You are a married woman: tis not permitted you to give great alms of your huſbands goods: But tis permitted, and it will be a good alms to ſerve, aſſiſt, and cherish with reſpect and ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derneſs,

            <p>You are a Counſellour, an Advocate, or a Solicitor; you have many Children and little means, and not able to give alms; But you may aſſiſt with your credit<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> counſell and ſervice, this poor widow<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> this orphan, poor man, and the like perſons. whom commonly men neglect. You may inſtruct in the Myſteries of faith, and in what is neceſſary to ſalvation, your domeſticks, ſervants, neigbors, and the poor that beg alms at your door; this is the beſt alms you can beſtow upon them: an alms more excellent than the corporal ſo much as the ſoul is better than the body: heaven than earth: the grace of God than money or bread. You have enemies that do you great injuries; if ſo: they are poor in vertue; ô what an excellent alms would you beſtow upon them, if you procure it them; and you will procure them vertue: if you gain their affection by pardoning them, and ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king their amity.

               </note> two ſorts of alms: the one of the heart: the other of the purs; you may excuſe your ſelves ſometimes from this, but not from that; the alms of the heart is to pardon your enemies, to love cordially your neighbors, to have pity and compaſſion on the poor, to be ſorry you have not wherewith to ſuccour them, and to pray God that the rich may help them; our Saviout ſays not only, <hi>give and it shal be given to you:</hi> but he ſays firſt, <hi>par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don, and you shal be pardoned.</hi> Behold how eaſily, and at how ſmall a rate you may buy the kingdom of heaven: ſee now when or in what time you muſt buy it.</p>
            <p>The time of buying it, is the time of this life only: do not as the foolish Virgins, who neglected to make proviſion of oyle till they were called before the Bridgroom: and whilſt they went to buy it, the Bridchamber door was shut and they exclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded for ever, Imitate rather the wiſe Virgins, make in time pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſion of oyle, and be not ſurpriz'd by death. Remember that two ſorts of oyle are neceſſary for us; shat of God on us:
<pb n="162" facs="tcp:108789:86"/> for woe to the moſt laudable life, if God examin it without mercy, ſayd S.

            </head>
            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg>T was with great reaſon, that God giving the Law to his people, did uſe this Preface, <hi>Ego ſum Dominus Deus tuus,</hi> I am the Lord thy God; For by many moſt juſt Titles He is our Lord, and hath right to command us, And to oblige us to pay dutys to his commande<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments and Orders, and principally three; we muſt ſtudy them: we muſt keep them: and we muſt love them.</p>
            <p n="1">1. In the firſt place we muſt ſtudy them, learn them, and me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditate upon them. Some will ſay: Who is he that is ignorant of them? what little ſchoolboy is there amongſt us that does not know the ten commandements? Yes, they can rehearſe them: but this is not enough; We muſt ſtudy them learn the ſenſe and meaning of them, and ſearch into the depth of them; David was a great Prophet, and he ſtudied them, ſearched into them, meditated upon them, and prayed God to teach him them: <hi>Give me underſtanding,</hi> ſayd he to God, <hi>and I will learn thy juſtifications;</hi> and to learn them he contemplated
<pb n="163" facs="tcp:108789:86"/> them attentively. And in effect, if it be neceſſary to ſtudy the rules of grammer, and of rhetorick, to learn to ſpeak well, is it not neceſſary to ſtudy the Law of God, and his Goſpell, to learn to live well, ſayd S. Auſtin? And S. Ambroſe ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kes us to conſider that in she book of Eccleſiaſtes the holy Ghoſt ſays not only, <hi>Mandata ejus ſerva,</hi> keep his Commandements, <note place="margin">
                  <hi>Eccleſ.</hi> 12. 13.</note> but <hi>obſerva,</hi> Note them, and ſearch into them diligently. For the Decalogue given to Moſes does nor declare ſo clearly all things that are neceſſary to be don, nor forbid ſo expreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſly many ſins which render us moſt criminal before God; we muſt then ponder them, examin, and conſider all the words, beg light of the holy Ghoſt, to find out the ſenſe<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning and intention of God.</p>
            <p n="2">2. Moreover the Commandements of the Decalogue were gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven to men, as men; But God gave moreover many to the Iews, as Iews: which made S. Paul ſay, He that made him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf a Iew, receiving Circumciſſion, oblig'd himſelf to keep <note place="margin">
                  <hi>Gal.</hi> 5. 3.</note> all the Law of Moſes. And to learn it well, the Iſraelites in the time of the Prophet Eſdras, made a Lecture of it four times a day: and in the time of S. Paul, on all Saturdays; ſo <note place="margin">2. <hi>Eſdras.</hi> 9. 3.</note> alſo the Son of God hath given other Commandements to Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians, as Chriſtians; which made the ſame Apoſtle ſay to the faithfull, <hi>They who obey not the Goſpell shal ſuffer eternal paines.</hi> 
               <note place="margin">2. <hi>Theſ.</hi> 1. 8.</note> We muſt be then ſolicitous to learn the Evangellical Comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dements, to read the books which treat of them, to aſſiſt at Sermons and Catechiſmes which teach them, to beg the grace of God to underſtand them, and to learn them not only, nor chiefly for to know them, but to keep them and to put them in practiſe; <hi>Thou haſt very much commanded thy commandements to be kept,</hi> ſays the Royal Prophet: Note very much, very much.</p>
            <p n="3">3. It is wonderfull to ſee with what earneſtneſs and inſtance God recommended to his people the memory and obſervance of them. Firſt He wrote them upon Tables of ſtone, to teach us to engrave in our hearts, what He vouchſafed to write with his own hand. Secondly He commanded a Tabernacle to be made, and within it an Arke of incorruptible wood, cover'd
<pb n="164" facs="tcp:108789:87"/> with fine gold, to lodge therein the Tables. In the third place, that the king of the people should write with his own hand theſe holy Commandements. In the fourth place He Commanded the people, that having paſſed Jordan, and entred into the land of promiſe, they should place great ſtones upon the shore, upon which the Commandements should be written, that all might be aſcertain'd if they kept them not, they should not enjoy long that happy land. And becauſe they would not be always there to read them often: He commanded them to be written upon the doores of all their houſes, to be imprinted in their hearts, and in the hearts of their children. Behold his words: <hi>theſe wordes</hi> 
               <note place="margin">

               <hi>which I command thee shal be in thy heart: and thou shalt tell them to thy children, and thou shalt meditate upon them ſitting in thy houſe, and walking on thy journey, ſleeping, and riſing. And thou shalt bind them as a ſigne in thy hand: and thou shalt write them in the entrie, and on the doores of thy houſe.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And becaus profit and recompence are the baits of humane hearts, He makes promiſes ſo advantagious to the obſervers of them, that they would be incredible, if any other then himſelf did make them. <hi>I will ſend you rain in time and ſeaſon, the earth</hi>

I will give peace in your coaſtes: you shal ſleep, and there shal be none to fright you. five of yours shal purſue a hundred ſtrangers, and a hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred of you, ten thouſand. I will reſpect you, and make you increaſe: you shal be multiplyd, and I will eſtablish my Covenant with you.</hi> Note that 'twas to the Iews He made theſe great promiſes, whom He was wont to recompence with worldly goods when they obſerv'd his Commandements, and chaſtiſe them with temporal punish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, when thy tranſgreſt them: becaus they were material, groſs and terreſtrial; But to Chriſtians, He promiſes Spiritual and Celeſtial goods, recompences that are eternal, ſo great, ſo charming, and ſo excellent, that the felicities He promiſed to the Iews, and which ſeem to us ſo admirable, are but sha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dows and figures of them.</p>
            <p n="4">4. But ſome will ſay, what will theſe great Promiſes avail us, if we cannot perform the condition under which they are made to us? and if we cannot keep the Commandements of God,
<pb n="165" facs="tcp:108789:87"/> alſo with that grace He gives us? Some indeed have ſayd this: But the Scriptures ſay quite the contrary; <hi>This commandement which I command thee is not above thee, </hi> ſays the eternal Father. <hi>My yoke</hi>

               <hi>is ſweet, and my burden light,</hi> ſays IESUS-CHRIST. <hi>His commandements are not heavy,</hi> ſayd his beloved Diſciple. And his Evangeliſt S. Luke does tell us. that <hi>Zachary and Elizabeth were juſt, and walked without reproof in all the Commandements and juſtifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of the Lord.</hi> And we alſo may do as they: Els God would be unjuſt, impoſing impoſſible commands upon us: cruel, in punishing us for not keeping them. and a mocker in promiſing us his heaven, if we shal obſerve them.</p>
            <p n="5">5. We ought alſo to keep theſe divine commandements, not with a ſervil fear, but with a filial love, as S. Auſtin ſays ſo often; not as ſlaves, but as children; <hi>for we have not received the ſpirit of ſervitude again in fear; But we have received the ſpirit of adoption of children,</hi> ſays S. Paul. And this David did yet in the old Law, repeating ſo often: <hi>I have loved your Law: I have affected your commandements: they are the ioy of my heart: I have loved them more than millions of gold: more than the Topaſe, and other precious ſtones: more than all the riches of the world: they are to me more ſweet than hony: I take more pleaſure in keeping them, than à Conquerour in burdening himſelf with ſpoiles.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And to ſee clearly that they are moſt reaſonable, moſt juſt, and moſt amiable: let us make a ſuppoſition, that there are but two Townes in this world: and that in one of them, all the inhabitants keep exactly the commandements of God: and that to the other God hath not given any commandements, but permits every one without punishment to live as he liſt; Is it not true that the former City would be a terreſtrial Paradiſe, a garden of delights a place of peace and tranquillity, an image of the ſtate of Innocency, and a foretaſte of Felicity. There would be no envy, no detraction, no quarrel, no enmitie, no inju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice, no fear or diffidence; there would be no need of bolts upon doores, nor locks upon coffers, nor of guards, nor ſenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nells, but upon the frontiers; But the other City where no body should be oblig'd to keep the commandements of God, would be a forreſt peopled with robbers, who would pillage one another:
<pb n="166" facs="tcp:108789:88"/> a den of Lyons, who would tear and eate each other: a Sty of hoggs, who would wallow in all ſorts of ordures.</p>
            <p n="6">6. Have we not then cauſe to thanke God for giving us com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandements ſo holy, ſo juſt, ſo ſaving, and ſo amiable? ought we not to ſubmit our ſelves with much reſpect to the orders of his ſoveraignity? The Epithetes which the ſcripture gives them ought to perſwade us to it. It ſays that they are <hi>Teſtimonies,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they teſtify to us, and certify us of that which God re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quires of us; That they are <hi>Iudgments</hi> becaus they will condemne us if that we tranſgreſs them; That they are <hi>juſtifications,</hi> becaus they juſtify us, and render us juſt before God when we keep them; That they are <hi>wayes</hi> and <hi>paths,</hi> becauſe we go to Heaven by the obſervance of them; which God of his mercy grant us. Amen.</p>

                  <hi>S. Aug. in Queſt. Ioſue.</hi> 22 30.</note> for to adore them. ſo the Iſraelites were fatiſfyd that the Tribes of Ruben and Gad erected not an Altar againſt the intention of the law, ſince they made it not for ſacrifice, but only for a monument.</p>
            <p>S. Admire here the goodneſs of God, who ſeperates us from idolatry, the moſt vile, foule, and cruel ſervitude imaginable: which made the poor idolaters to ſerve a thouſand moſt vile and moſt baſe Maſters: which urged men and women in their publick ſervice to actions ſo foul and impudent, that impu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence it ſelf would blush to ſee. or hear of them: which engaged them to ſuch inhumanities and cruelties in their ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifices, that we cannot without horrour ſpeak or thinke of them. And He does not only endeavour to free men from this moſt hard and pernicious ſlavery: but moreover binds them to himſelf; not that He hath any want of us; He hath no ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed of our goods, nor of our ſervice: He was moſt happy from all Eternity, and would be for all Eternity without us; But it is, becaus He deſires that we be perfect: He will that we be
<pb n="169" facs="tcp:108789:89"/> happy and He ſees that our perfection conſiſts in loving and ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving him; And therefore He moves and ſolicits us to it by moſt effectual means; He commands ſtrictly, and threatens the tranſgreſſours of his command to punish them in their children to the third and fourth generation: and to move our mercenary hearts yet more, He promiſes to recompence our obedience in thouſands; and all this is but a pledg and gage of the gre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>at goods which He prepared and promiſed us if we love him and keep his commandements.</p>
            <p n="4">4. After ſuch Commands, threatnings and promiſes, can we thinke that a great Church, a Church ſo learned, ſo curious and carefull in other points, and ſo addicted to good workes, would give ſupream honour, divine worship and adoration to Saints, and to their Relicks, which she believes to be no Gods? Nay, to ſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tues and pictures, which she declares to have no Divinity or ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue: and this with the loſs of Gods favour, forfeiture of his pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes, labour in this world, eternal punishment in the other: and without gain of any honor, pleaſure, or profit whatſoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver?</p>
            <p>May be believe that CHRIST having banished Idolls out of the world for ever, or out of the greater part of it: as it was by the Prophets foretold He should: and that the Turks, who adore <note place="margin">
                  <hi>Iſaiah.</hi> 2. 18. <hi>Zachar. c.</hi> 13. V. 2.</note> him not, and the jews, his greateſt enemies, enjoy the fruit and accomplishment of this promiſe: and Chriſtians, who ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nor, adore and love him should not, but should live and dye in Image, Saint, and Hoſt Idolatry? He hath not made by himſelf or his Apoſtles Idolatry to ceaſe one only moment of time, if it be Idolatry to adore the B. Sacrament, to honor the Saints, their Relicks and their Images ſo as the Romane Church does honour them: ſince theſe things have been ſo practiſed in all times, in both Greek and Latine Church. You ſee then, that to make Catholicks Idolaters, is to tear one of the moſt pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious and replendent jewells out of the Crown of JESVS: that it is to make the Prophets of his Father Lyars: and that it is to give occaſion to Infidells to make him this reproach <hi>Thy Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets ſee vain things. and divine a ly.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Is it Poſſible, that the Catholick or univerſall Church, the Church

               <hi>Her;</hi> That He <hi>would be with her all days even to the conſummation of the world; That He would preſerve her from falling into errors, and guid her into all truth; the Church which God Eſpouſed to himſelf for ever,</hi> The Church, which He obliged all to believe and follow: <hi>I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve the holy Catholick Church.</hi> Is it poſſible, I ſay, that she breaks always notoriouſly the firſt commandement, by teaching and committing Idolatry? It is impoſſible she should adore any other thing than God alone. Note that I ſay <hi>Adore.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="5">5. For though this word <hi>Adore,</hi> is uſed in the Bible, and in the Hebrew, Greek, and Latine tongues, to ſignify all ſorts of honor; ſupream and divine honor which is given to God only, Pſalme 96. where it is ſayd, <hi>adore him all ye Angells.</hi> In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feriour honour which is given to Saints, Ioſuah 5. 14. where it is ſayd, that Ioſuah adoted an Angell. Humane and civill honor, which is given to men on earth, 3. kings 1. 23. where 'tis ſayd the Prophet Nathan adored David; and in many other places it does ſignify theſe three different ſorts of honour; Nevertheleſs, ſince this word <hi>Adore</hi> does ſignify in our language divine honor, and worship proper to God alone, I ſay.</p>
            <p n="6">6. We adore not the Saints; becaus we acknowledg not ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veraign and ſupream excellency and perfection in them. But we give them an inferiour honor according to their dignity, their holineſs, and relation to God; for according to the law of God, and reaſon, a proportionable honor is due to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellency.</p>
            <p n="7">7. Secondly, we honor and Venerate the Relicks of the Saints, though with an honor inferior to that we give to the Saints themſelves, For we find in Relicks ſome dignity, ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lineſs, and relation to God. They were the living members of CHRIST, and Tempells of the holy <hi>Ghoſt;</hi> They are the Organs and Inſtruments of God, by which He workes many miracles, and imparts divers benefits to men; and they shal be one day raiſed up again, to be the habitations of glorious ſouls, and to live and reign with CHRIST; therefore they deſerve ſome
<pb n="171" facs="tcp:108789:90"/> reſpect, and the primitive Church, as the holy Fathers teſtify, did not deny it them.</p>
            <p>Thirdly we adore not Images and pictures. For we know and believe that there is no divinity in them. Neither do we give them any inferior honor, veneration or reſpect abſolutely, or for themſelves, or which is terminated upon them; becaus we acknowledg not any vertue or perfection in them that deſerves it from us. But ſeeing that the holy Fathers declare: all Nations acknowledg: and nature it ſelf does teach, that the honor or dishonor don to an Image is referr'd to the Prototype or thing repreſented, and is don by the Image to it; We do not with the Iconoclaſt Hereticks break them, trample them under feet and deface them as prophane, or ſcoff at them as Idolls; But on the contrary, we reſerve them, lodg them decently, make good uſes of them, and in occaſion we kiſs them, we put off our hats and bow or kneell before them, for to adore IESUS-CHRIST, and honor his Saints by them. And ſurely all this practiſe is ſome part of Chriſtian duty; ſince neither common ſence, reaſon<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> nor religion, will permit us to do leſs in this behalf to our <hi>Saviour</hi> and his friends in heaven, then that which others do to honor, and to shew their love to men on earth.</p>
            <p n="9">9. Is it not then very ſtrange that ſome will hold, that to ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nor IESUS-CHRIST by his image, is forbidden? And is not this as unreaſonable as that is ſtrange, to conclude from a faſly ſuppoſed prohibition, that the worship is therefore ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minated upon the image, and is Idolatrous? We have shewn that it is not forbidden by the Law to honor CHRIST by his image, but to honor the image it ſelf for CHRIST, or inſtead of CHRIST. And now we add that in caſe it were in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed forbidden yet it would not be Idolatry: it would be ſtil the worship of the true God: it would terminate upon Him, as well as the offerings of the blind and lame, which God had forbidden, and yet complains, that the jewes by them polluted Him; It would terminate upon him as well as blaſphe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my, <note place="margin">
                  <hi>Malac.</hi> 1.</note> and other crimes, which He forbids: It would be then
<pb n="172" facs="tcp:108789:91"/> diſobedience, or ſome other ſin: But not Idolatry, by which one gives Gods honor to a creature.</p>
            <p n="10">10. oh! your ignorant people at leaſt, do adore images them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves: they pray to them and demand ſuccour from them, as from God: and therefore it is better that the uſe of them should be abolished, than that it should be the occaſion of Idolatry.</p>
            <p>It is very hard to judg that any are ſo ignorant; ſince they cannot learn the firſt Article of the Creed, nor the firſt of the Commandements but they muſt know, that images are not Gods, nor to be adored: and ſince they muſt be as ſenſeleſs as the images themſelves, that will pray to them, or demand help of them.</p>
            <p>But ſuppoſe there happen ſome abuſe; this muſt be very rare, and eaſily removed: and therefore is to be amended by inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, not by the abolishing of the adundant good uſe of images.</p>
            <p>They go on to make us Tranſgreſſours of this commandement, and Idolaters; They ſay that we honour the Saints with divine worship, and do them Soveraign homage: that we do not only implore their in<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

            <p n="11">11. Theſe are great miſtakes; for we believe that God alone i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

            <p n="12">12. Nor is there a leſs miſtake in the other part of the ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jection; For we build no Churches, erect not Altars, nor offer
<pb n="173" facs="tcp:108789:91"/> Sacrifice to Saints; For as S. Denys ſays, the Temple is for the altar, the Altar is for the Prieſt, the Prieſt is for Sacrifice, and Sacrifice is for God only. And when we name the Church of S. Steeven, the Altar of S. Peter, or the Maſs of our Lady: We underſtand that the Church is dedicated, the Alter conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crated, and the Maſs offered ro God, in thankſgiving for the favours He hath don to the Virgin, to S. Peter, or to S. Steeven; as when we name the Maſs of the dead, of marriage, of peace, of Travellers: It is becaus we offer the ſacrifice to God, to demand of him reſt of ſoules, benediction of Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage, peace between Princes, and a good journey for Tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vellers. See what the Councel of Trent, who knew beſt the faith and practiſe of the Church does ſay of it: <hi>Though that the Church celebrates ſometimes Maſses in the honor and memory of Saints: she</hi> 
               <note place="margin">
                  <hi>ſſ.</hi> 22. 3.</note> 
               <hi>teaches nevertheleſs, that it is not to them that she offers ſacrifice, but to God alone, who hath crowned them; whence it is that the Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt ſays not, S. Peter S. Paul, I offer to you this Sactifice, but to God, to whom he gives thanks for their Victories imploring their inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſion.</hi> And ſo S. Auſtin teaches, anſwering Fauſtus the Mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chean Heretick, who made the ſame objection againſt the Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licks <note place="margin">

               </note> of his time.</p>
            <p>Some perhaps will ſay they cannot underſtand, how we can offer Sacrifice to the honor of a Saint, and not ſacrifice to the Saint, for whoſe honor it is offered.</p>
            <p n="13">13. Know then, that honor is but a ſigne, a teſtimony, or proteſtation of ſome excellency; and that thanks given to God by words or Sacrifice, for the gifts or graces beſtowed on ſuch perſons, is a teſtimony or proteſtation of ſuch excellencie in thoſe perſons, and therefore for their honor: though both words and Sacrifice be directed to God, and not to them. If Proteſtants should keep a ſolemn day of thanksgiving to God for the wit and zeal their Doctor hath shewn againſt Popery: this would be much to his honor, though the thankes be given to God, and not to him.</p>
            <p n="14">14. Let us learn then by the unfortunate failings of others, not to blaſpheme that which we underſtand not; Let us not fear
<pb n="174" facs="tcp:108789:92"/> Idolatry or fals worship following the general practiſe of that Church, which alone does labour to extirpate Paganiſme, to ruine Idolls and Idolatry, and to put in vogue this comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dement. But Let us beware to make other Idolls in our ſelves and to our ſelves, which are harder to be extirpated, and as pernicious to Salvation as thoſe of Pagans. For if we prefer our judgment before that of the Catholick Church, we make an Idoll of our fancy or opinion, and adore it. If we affect a Cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ature diſordinately againſt the commandement of God, we erect an Idoll in our heart, and adore it. If we are intemperate, ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject to drunkenneſs or to gluttony, S. Paul ſays to us, that our <hi>belly is our God.</hi> if we are avaricious, he declares to us, that <note place="margin">
                  <hi>Philip.</hi> 3. 19. <hi>Colloſs.</hi> 3. 5. <hi>Ephes</hi> 5.</note> gold and ſilver are our Idolls. if we are unchaſt, we adore an Idoll of flesh. If it be our deſigne to greaten our ſelves and to make our fortune at what rate ſoever, our idolls are the world and its vanities, or our children. If we cloath our ſelves exceſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vely, our Idolls are our bodys; in a word, all that weighs moſt in the ballance of our affections is our God, ſays S. Auſtin.</p>
            <p>Banish then all ſuch inordinate affections; honor and adore the true God only; give your ſelves to him without reſerve: love him, bleſs him, fear him, ſerve him with all your heart; refer to him all that you do, all that you ſay, all that you are, He only is your treaſure, your refreshment, your life, and your glory; He alone is your honour, proſperity, and felicity in ſoul and body, in time and in eternity, upon earth and in Heaven: where He will ſatiate and make you perfectly happy by the enjoyment of his eternal glory. Amen.</p>

            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">A</seg>S by this commandement God excludes vnjuſt worship and adoration of fals Gods: So by the ſame He demands juſt honor and ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mage which we owe to the only true God. It is by the Vertue of Religion that we ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quit our ſelves of this obligation; For this vertue moves us to give to God the honour, worship and adoration due to him by rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of the infinite Excellence of his nature, and ſovereignity over althings; It teaches us to honor him by our Vnderſtanding and our Will, with our Body and ou<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

               </gap> goods: and moreover to honour althings that are ſpecially referr'd to him; And this is that which is exacted of us by this Commandement: and which we shal shew in this Diſcours.</p>
            <p n="1">1. The Vertue of Religion hath this Excellency amongſt other moral Vertues, that we may practiſe it in all occaſions, and in all times. We have always the object of it: great reaſon: and Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er to do it. <hi>The object:</hi> God is always near us, we are in his preſence, He is always great and worthy of honor. <hi>Great reaſon:</hi> He obliges us inceſſantly, we receive from him continually Being, Preſervation, Motion; we should think of him as often as we bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ath, if we could; and He did require it of us; we have always <hi>Power</hi> to exerciſe this Vertue: for there is no need of riches,
<pb n="176" facs="tcp:108789:93"/> ſtrength of body, fine words: It is practiſed by the motion of the heart, by the affection of the ſoul, by the acts of the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding and the Will.</p>
            <p n="2">2. By the underſtanding we muſt conceive a high and great eſteem of his Greatneſs and Excellence, of his Power, Wiſdom, Goodneſs, Iuſtice, and other Perfections: apprhend lively, believe firmly, profeſs humbly, that He is infinitely Powerfull<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Wiſe, Good: that whatſoever He does, He does it moſt wiſely, juſtly, holily; that all that we can think, all that the Angells can con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive of his Greatneſs is nothing to that He is.</p>
            <p>We muſt acknowledg before God, that he is our Creator, Beginning, laſt End, ſoveraign Good, true Treaſure, only Beatitude: that He is our legal Lord, ſoveraign King: that He can diſpoſe of us more juſtly, and abſolutely, then a King of his Vaſſal, then a Maſter of his ſlave, then a Potter of his earthen Veſſel: that if He should take our Children from us, our goods, honor, life without having given Him any occaſion of offence He would not do us injury, would uſe his right, would be in ſo doing moſt juſt, amiable, and adorable.</p>
            <p>By our will, we muſt reſolve to do promptly all that we know conduces to the ſervice of God, and to the advancement of his glory, and to avoyd all things which diſpleas Him: To de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire and beg frequently the things that are convenient to be asked of him: that ſo we may honour and reverence Him, by ſubmitting our ſelves to him, and by acknowledging that we have need of him, and totally rely on him. To adore him often, profeſſing ſubjection to his divine Will, in acknowledgment of his excellen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy and infinite Majeſty, and our ſubjection and dependance on Him.</p>
            <p n="3">3. And becaus we are compoſed of ſoulw and body, and rece<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ive them, and all other goods from him, we owe him not only the interiour, but alſo the exteriour acts of Religion; ſuch is Sacrifice, by which we honour him as our God and Soveraign, profeſſing his ſupream Dominion, and a dependency of all things on him; we thanke him for Benefits: ſatisfy his ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice: and implore ſuccour of our neceſſities; ſuch is the uſe of Sacraments, by which we tacitely proteſt, that God is the Sanctifier
<pb n="177" facs="tcp:108789:93"/> and the Authour of grace which ſubjects to him more and more our Souls. Such are genuflections, proſtrations, to teſtify by theſe ſignes the high eſteem we have of his Greatneſs, and our ſubmiſſion to him. Such in fine are thankes, Vocal prayers, prayſes<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and other like tributes of honor and homage which we pay to him. We ought more over to employ our labour<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and to uſe our goods for the ſervice of him: Yea, to contemne our honor, and ſacrifice our lives, in a juſt occaſion.</p>
            <p n="4">4. And ſince all that is in God, is God, and conſequently ami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able, honourable, and adorable: we ought alſo to honor and ado<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>re all his divine Attributes and Perfections, cheifly in occaſions when it pleaſes him to practiſe them; When he ſends proſperi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties to vertuous people, or to their children, adore his fidelity who promiſed to favour the vertuous; when He gives goods to ill men, adore his Goodneſs, who does good to his Enemies; when He calls a juſt man out of this life, who ſeem'd neceſſary in this world, adore his Independence, who hath not need of his creatures; when He preſerves in life the Vicious, adore his Patience and Longanimitie; When He ſends afflictions. adore his juſtice.</p>
            <p n="5">5. In fine the Vertue of Religion obliges us to reverence God not only in himſelf, and in his divine Perfections: But alſo in his Friends and Servants, in the Times, and Places, which are par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticularly conſecrated to his ſervice, and in all that hath a ſpecial reſpect and relation to his Majeſty. It was by this diſpoſition that <note place="margin">
                  <hi>Ioſuah</hi> 5. <hi>Gen.</hi> 48. 16. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 138. <hi>Or.</hi> 139. <hi>Apoc.</hi> 1. 4.</note> Ioſuah honoured the Angel that appeared to him. That Iacob pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yed an Angel to bleſs his Children. That David honoured very much the friends of God. And that S. Iohn Evangeliſt implores the aſſiſtance of Angells to obtain grace and peace from God.</p>
            <p>It was by the ſame Vertue that great S. Antony honoured Prieſts as Miniſters of Chriſts Inheritance, Officers of his Crown and Diſpenſers of his treaſures: and that meeting even the leaſt of them, he fell upon his knees and demanded his Benediction. By this Vertue S. Charles the Great entred into Rome and vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſited a foote the Churches of it, embraſed and kiſſed with de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>votion the Pillars of them. By this Vertue another Saint Charles, the Cardinal Boromeus honoured ſo much the holy ſcripture, that alſo ſtudying it, he read it always kneeling and uncover'd
<pb n="178" facs="tcp:108789:94"/> The ſeraphical Saint Francis commanded, that papers which had the name of God written in them, should not be Prophan'd but plac'd in decent and convenient places. S. Lewis forbid painting and graving of the Croſs upon the pavement, for fear the people should tread upon it. On Feſtivalls and Vigills, in honor of the Saint celebrated, or of the Miſtery ſolemnized, he gave dinner to two hundred Poore, and ſerv'd them at the table. He faſted all fridays of the yeare: and in thoſe of Advent and Lent, he eate neither fish nor fruit, becaus theſe two Times are conſecrated to God.</p>
            <p n="6">6. If theſe great Saints were now on earth, what would they ſay, what would they do ſeeing the comportment of men? What thinke they now in heaven ſeeing the irreligion of thoſe, who will not allow them any honor, though God does honor them and honor be a due ſalary of their Vertue; who count it ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perſtition <note place="margin">

What thinke they ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the indevotion of others, who riſe in the morning, and go to bed at night as beaſts: who ſit down to table at noon as Epicurians, and paſs over the day as if there were no God; who even fear to aſſiſt often at the Sacrifice, to frequent the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, to adore God, and pray him as they ought, leſt men laugh at them, and call them devotes. or hypocrites, though they are not aſhamed to do ill in open ſtreet. What do they think in fine ſeeing ſuch irreverences of men towards holy things? They employ the time of holy days, in playing, in viſits, and drunken<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs; if they diſcours for pleaſure and recreation, it ſeems not well ſeasoned if it clash not upon Prieſts, or Religious Perſons; if they com to the Church, it is not to appeaſe God, but to offend him, to ſee and to be ſeen; They prophane the holy ſcripture, and uſe it in their jeſts, meriments, and Scurrilities.</p>
            <p n="7">7. <hi>Si Ego Pater, ubi eſt honor meus?</hi> If I am the Father. where is my honour? He might have ſayd, if I am King, If I am Iudg. If nature teaches the moſt barbarous to honour their father who is more worthy of honor than He from whom we have re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived, not Body only, but alſo Soul and All?</p>
            <p n="8">
               <pb n="179" facs="tcp:108789:94"/> 8. If we honor the King. and alſo the Courtiers for his ſake: should we not honor the King of kings, ſo great, powerfull, and Soveraign, that all the Kings of the world are his Uaſſalls, and are but wormes in reſpect of Him.</p>
            <p n="9">9. If we honor Iudges, becaus they have ſome Power in this world: ought we not to honor him who is infinitely powerfull, and from whom all power is dereiv'd? And give alſo an inferiour honour to the Saints, whom God does ſo much honor, that He makes them our Iudges; <hi>You shal ſit,</hi> ſays our great Iudg, <hi>upon</hi>

            </p>
            <p>Let us remember then, what God ſays to Samuel, <hi>whoſoever shal glorify me, I will glorify him: and they that contemne me shal be baſe;</hi> If we neglect the ſervice of God: if we reſpect not his friends, and althings that ſpecially appertain to him: ſooner or later, we shal be contemn'd, co<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="2 letters">

Iames; But in this ſin the Verity of God joyns it ſelf to juſtice, and obliges God to punish the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phaner, leſt his word do fail. Is it not then a miſery which de ſerves to be deplor'd with teares of blood, to ſee that there is nothing ſo licenciouſly and frequently prophan'd and abuſ'd by Chriſtians as the name of God, by pronouncing his holy name irreverently: violating Vowes unworthily: ſwearing falſly, or pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phanely: Curſing, or blaſpheming deteſtably.</p>
            <p n="2">
               <pb n="181" facs="tcp:108789:95"/> 2. But ſome will ſay: Oathes are they eſſentially naught? Is it not permitted to ſwear ſometimes? Yes 'tis lawfull: ſince the Scripture permits and approves it: Saints have practiſed it: and God himſelf vouchſafes to ſweare. The Prophet Hieremy permits us <note place="margin">
                  <hi>Hierem:</hi> 4. 2. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 62. 12. <hi>Apoc.</hi> 10. 6. <hi>Gen.</hi> 14. 22. 3. <hi>kings</hi> 17. 1. <hi>Rom.</hi> 19. 2. <hi>Cor.</hi> 1. 23. <hi>Gal.</hi> 1. 20 <hi>Gen.</hi> 22. 16. <hi>Hier.</hi> 22. 24. <hi>Luke.</hi> 1. 73. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 109</note> to ſweare in the name of God, provided it be with all neceſſary circumſtances. David praiſes thoſe that ſweare by the true God, not by fals Deities as Pagans did. Angells, Patriarks, Prophets, and Apoſtles have ſometimes ſworn. An Angel in the Apocalyps <hi>lifts up his hand to heaven, and ſweares by him that lives for ever and ever, that after judgment there will be no more time.</hi> In the book of Geneſis, the Patriarke Abraham ſays to the King of Sodom, <hi>I lift up my hand to the moſt high Majeſty of God who poſſeſſes heaven and Earth.</hi> In the third book of kings the Prophet Elias ſayd, <hi>by the living God in whoſe ſight I ſtand.</hi> S. Paul in his Epiſtle to the Romans, <hi>God is my witneſs that without intermiſſion I make a memory of you.</hi> In the ſecond to the Corinthians, <hi>I call God to witneſs upon my ſoul, that ſparing you, I came not any more to Corinth.</hi> And in the Epiſtle to the Galatians, <hi>Behold before God, that I ly not.</hi> God himſelf whoſe leaſt word is more firm then heaven and earth, having nothing greater then himſelf vouchſafes to ſweare by himſelf, and by his life. And the Pſalmiſt ſays expreſly <hi>The Lord hath Sworn.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="3">3. It is true then, that abſolutely ſpeaking, an Oath that is accompanied with all its circumſtances, is neither mortal, nor venial ſin: on the contrary, it is a vertuous and meritorious action; It is an Act of the vertue of Religion, which hath for its object the payment to God and his divine Perfections, the honour and homage that we owe him. When an oath is well made, we honor the Immenſitie, Science, and Veracity of God; Calling him to witneſs what we ſay. we acknowledg him to be in all places, preſent with all his creatures: to know all that paſſeth in this world: and to be the Soveraign and infal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lible Verity, Source and Origin of all verity, who authorizes by his teſtimony all truthes.</p>
            <p n="4">4. There are divers ſorts of oathes: But that I may not bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den your memory, I will diſtinguish them into 3. kinds only, which Divinity calls, <hi>Aſsertory, Promiſſory, Execratory.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="5">5 Firſt the <hi>Aſſertory</hi> is, when you aſcertain any thing that is
<pb n="182" facs="tcp:108789:96"/> paſt or preſent, calling God to witneſs what you ſay: calling him I ſay, either by himſelf, as when you ſay, by God, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore God, I ſay this in the preſence of God: or by ſome crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture <note place="margin">
                  <hi>S. Matt.</hi> 5.</note> that hath relation to him, as when you ſay, by my ſoul, by this light, by this fire; ſo JESVS-CHRIST ſays in the Goſpell, <hi>that to ſweare by heaven, is to ſweare by the Throne of God: to ſweare by the earth, is to ſwear by the footſtool of his feet.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="6">6. Secondly the <hi>Promiſſory</hi> is, when you promis under oath to do, or not to do any thing. And You commit perjury and offend God mortally, if you have not an intention to do, or not to do what you promis: or if you know that you cannot do it: or if afterward you voluntarily fail to do what you pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſed, in a matter of importance.</p>
            <p n="7">7. In the third place, the <hi>Execratory,</hi> or oath of <hi>imprecation</hi> is then, when to aſſure any thing, you call God not only to witneſs what you ſay, but you call him moreover to reveng the ly, in caſe you ſay not true; as when you ſay: God punish me: may I die preſently: never may I go out of this place: Never may I ſee God: the Divell take me, if this be not true; it is as much as if you ſayd: if I ſay not true, I will that God permit that I die, that I never depart from hence, that the Divell carry me away &amp;c.</p>
            <p n="8">8. And it happens ſometimes, that God takes ſuch ſwearers at their word, and ſends them the evill which they wished. Niceforus Calixtus ſays, that three Calumniators accuſing the Biſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hop Narciſſus of Adultery one of them ſayd, that he would dye if what he affirmed was not true: another, that he would be burnt: the third, that he might never ſee. The firſt died ſud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>denly: the ſecond was burnt with his houſe, by a ſpark of fire that fell from his lamp: the third having ſeen the punishment of his complices, repented of his fault, and wept ſo bitterly that he loſt his ſight.</p>
            <p n="9">9. The Prophet Hieremiah above cited, marks out to us the conditions wherewith an oath muſt be accompanied that it be not vitious, but vertuous and meritorious: <hi>Iurabis, vivit Dominus, in veritate, in justitia, &amp; judicio:</hi> He permits you to ſweare by the life of God, or other oath, provided, that it be with
<pb n="183" facs="tcp:108789:96"/> truth, with juſtice, and with diſcretion.</p>
            <p>10. Firſt with truth, this circumſtance is ſo abſolutely neceſſary to an oath, that if you ſwear an untruth, or are not ſure of what you ſweare, it is a perjury, though it should be about the vallue of a pin.</p>
            <p>I ſay though it should be upon the matter of a pin; for it is not in this ſin as in other kinds of crimes<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> wherein the levitie of the matter makes the ſin to be but venial; here the levitie of the matter diminishes not the ſin, but encreaſes the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lice of it; for it is a greater contempt of God to abuſe his au<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>thority, and to call him to witneſs an untruth for a thing that is friyolous, and of little conſequence.</p>
            <p n="11">11. And we muſt not only not ſweare to aſſert an expreſs and formally, But not alſo to confirm a diſguiſed and palliated untruth. I call palliated lyes, equivocations, ambiguous words and of a double meaning; for theſe deceive men: they are ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>til and crafty cheats; And is it not a great evill to make uſe of the name of God, and his credit, to cheat and deceive men? S. Iſidore and S. Bernard tell us, that what ever arti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice of equivocation we uſe in ſwearing, God who ſees our con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience, <note place="margin">
                  <hi>S. Iſod. lib.</hi> 2. <hi>ſent.</hi> 6. 31. <hi>S. Ber. lib. de mod. bene vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vendi: ſer.</hi> 32. <hi>Aug. Ep.</hi> 224. <hi>ad Alipium.</hi>
               </note> takes our words according to the ſenſe that he to whom we ſweare does underſtand them. S. Auguſtine concludes the ſame: <hi>I doubt not</hi> ſays he, <hi>but you ought to keep the fidelity of your promiſe, according as he to whom you ſwore did underſtand it, and not according to the ambiguity of your word;</hi> whence it follows that those are perjured, who contenting them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves to perform their words according to their own concealed ſence of them, have deceived the thoughts and expectations of him to whom they ſwore; and conſequently shal not be ſaved: ſince the Prophet ſays, that to go to heaven, one muſt not in ſwea<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ring deceive his Neighbor; <hi>Qui jurat proximo ſuo, &amp; non decipit.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="12">12 Secondly, you muſt ſweare with juſtice: that is to ſay: you muſt not ſweare but that which is juſt and lawfull, And therefore they ſin grievouſly, who ſwear to reveng themſelves, or to do any thing diſpleaſing to God. They are not at all oblig'd to keep ſuch oathes: ſince nobody can be oblig'd to do ill; Nay, they are oblig'd not to keep them, becaus the Law of God obliges them, not to do ſuch things.</p>
            <p n="13">
               <pb n="184" facs="tcp:108789:97"/> 13. In the third place, it muſt be with judgment, that is with prudence and maturity, for things neceſſary, and of importance, and by reaſon of ſome obligation grounded in a vertue, as charity, juſtice, or obedience: For to ſweare lightly, rashly, without juſt cauſe or neceſſity, though it be for verity, is a ſin, and moreover the cauſe of many inconve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nients; It is an irreverence and a diſhonour of God to call him for witneſs in things that are frivolous, or of little or no impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance; 'Tis as if Lackeys playing in the court of Whitehall, should call the King to be Arbitrator in all their childish diſputes and differences.</p>
            <p n="14">14. But take the inconveniences which do follow this accurſed language from Eccleſiaſticus, or rather from the holy Ghoſt: <hi>A man that is given to ſwearing shall be filled with iniquity, and</hi>

               </gap>k in the fields, except one mile, or there about: And we do on ſunday theſe workes which were forbidden. The day of reſt began from the evening of its Vigil: and we begin it, but after mid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>night: Who hath given us all theſe diſpenſations? Who hath li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cenced us to break all theſe Lawes? We find not in the new Teſtament one only word that gives us a playn and clear excuſe. We read indeed in the Apocalyps, that S. Iohn was in ſpirit upon our Lords day; there was then ſuch a day as our Lords <note place="margin">
                  <hi>Apoc.</hi> 1.</note> day; But a Sabbatharian will ſay to us: he does not tell you that the Sanctification given to ſaturday was taken from that day; nor that there was given a command to all the world, not to worke upon that day which he called our Lords day; nor does it appear there, or elswhere in the ſcripture, that it was not
<pb n="188" facs="tcp:108789:99"/> the day of the Reſurrection, or Aſcenſion, or Chriſtmas day which S. Iohn called our Lords day.</p>
            <p>We read again in the Acts, that the firſt chriſtians met upon the firſt day of the week which is our ſunday, to communicate. But <note place="margin">
                  <hi>Acts.</hi> 20. 7.</note> a Sabbatharian wil reply again what then? The Text does not ſay they aſſembled always on that day: or only on that day: yea we read in the Acts, that they communicated very frequently, <note place="margin">
                  <hi>Acts.</hi> 2.</note> or every day; How do you then inferr from their communica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting once upon that day, that the Sabbath was abrogated, and the Sunday was ſubrogated in its place? Nay, you find in the new Law, that though the old Law was by CHRIST eva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuated, yet the ten Commandements were by Him confirm'd; For in S. Matthew, one came to our Saviour ſaying, what good shal I do that I may have everlaſting life? Our Saviour <note place="margin">
                  <hi>Matth.</hi> 10.</note> anſwered, <hi>keep the commandements.</hi> And when that man reply'd to know what commandements? Our Lord explicated himſelf to mean thoſe Commandements, which that man knew very well, <note place="margin">

               </note> as appears alſo in S. Mark, and in S. Luke,</p>
            <p>Secondly S: Paul in his firſt Epiſtle to the Corinthians ſays, <hi>Circumciſion is nothing, and prepuce is nothing, but the obſervance of the Commandements of God;</hi> this is the thing you muſt look too, if you will have everlaſting life. Behold here that great Apoſtle tels you, rhat even then, when Circumciſion was abolished, and made nothing, yet the obſervance of the Commandements, and he excepts not one, was neceſſary to ſalvation. And our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour foretelling his Apoſtles the deſtruction of Hieruſalem, which was to be 40. yeares after his Reſurrection, when one would think the obſervance of the Sabbath would have been, <note place="margin">
                  <hi>S. Matth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ew.</hi> 24. 20.</note> if ever it were to be abolished: yet He bids them pray, that their flight might not be upon the Sabbath or the 7. th day for to avoyd the prophanation of that day.

               </note> and long after S. Paul bids Chriſtians to make their col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lections upon the firſt day of the week: from whence you draw another argument: though the Apoſtle does not ſo much as ſay, that they did uſe to meet that day: and ſeems to appoint that day only for a pious beginning of the week.</p>

               <pb n="189" facs="tcp:108789:99"/> 2. Since then the Scriptures are not clear for us in this im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portant point: yea, ſeem rather to be againſt us; How do we know that the obligation of ſanctifying the Sabbath or ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venth day was taken away? And how do we know that a new obligation of ſanctifying the Sunday was put upon us? we know it by the ſame way we know the Bible is the Word of God: that the Creed was made by the Apoſtles: that infants are to be baptized: that the prohibition of the new Law to eate ſuffoca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted <note place="margin">
                  <hi>Acts.</hi> 15.</note> meats and blood is repeal'd: and to be short, as we know other things of great importance not written, or not plainly <note place="margin">2. <hi>Thes.</hi> 2. 15.</note> declar'd in Scripture: And this is <hi>Apoſtolical Tradition,</hi> which S. Paul bids us hold; For the Church by the inſtruction of the Apoſtles tells us plainly, that the Son of God hath freed us from all obligation to ſanctify the Sabbath of the Iewes: and hath in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtituted Sunday for us Chriſtians. For on this day, the prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipal Workes attributed to the moſt holy Trinity, and don in favour of us, were begun or accomplished. It was on Sunday that God began to create the World; It was on Sunday, that our Saviour came into the world: that He was born of the B. Virgin: and that he roſe again from the dead; It was on Sun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>day, that the holy Ghoſt deſcended upon the Faithfull to ſanc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tify the world.</p>
            <p n="3">3. Theſe incomparable Workes should be the object of our devo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion on Sundays to conforme our ſelves to the intentions of our Saviour, and of the Church. For this Commandement is both affirmative, and negative; as negative, it forbids ſervil workes: as affirmative, it commands us to ſanctify the day: that is to employ the day in holy Workes: as in aſſiſting devout<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly at divine ſervice, in praying, in contemplating particularly thoſe great workes of God, for to admire the excellencie of them, and to thank, bleſs, and praiſe him for them: in receiving the Sacraments, in reading ſpiritual books, in hearing the word of God, in viſiting the Poor, Sick, and Priſoners, which is an act af Religion ſays S. Iames: in inſtructing one another in the Myſteries of Faith, in the Commandements of God, in <note place="margin">

               </gap>erein light and guidance for all the week, by ſermons, catechiſmes, ſpiritual reading, and meditation. If then we employ great part of the day in dancing, playing and recreating our ſelves, we offend not indeed aga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>inſt the negative Commandement, which forbids ſervil workes, but we do not accomplish perfectly the affirmative precept, which commands us to ſanctify the day.</p>
            <p n="4">4. They violate the negative Commandement who employ the holy days in traficking, in buying or ſelling, or other ſervil and mercenary employments: and are ſubjects of the complaynt which God makes by Ezechiel. <hi>The houſes of Iſrael provoked me, and my</hi>

            <p n="4">4: The ſecond honour of our Parents exacted by this Comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dement, is that of Obedience; This honor S. Paul often recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mends to us, and in the Epiſtle to the Epheſians he proves it by this commandement to be their due: <hi>Obey your Parents in our</hi> 
               <note place="margin">
                  <hi>Ephes.</hi> 6.</note> 
               <hi>Lord: For this is juſt: Honour thy Father and thy Mother.</hi> He adds <hi>In our Lord:</hi> For if they command you any thing againſt the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandements of God, or of his Church: or if they would avert you from Religion and his ſervice, S. Bernard tells you, that <note place="margin">
                  <hi>Epiſt:</hi> 104.</note> 'tis Piety to neglect them for the love of IESUS-CHRIST; for He that ſayd: Honor your Father and your Mother: ſays to you alſo, <hi>He that loves his father or his mother more than me, is not worthy</hi>
               <pb n="194" facs="tcp:108789:102"/> 
               <hi>of me.</hi> But when they command juſt and lawfull things, you muſt obey them, they are your Superiours, and the Cauſes of your Being: they then as Superiours ought to move you: and as Cauſes of your Being, to be alſo the Authours of your operations. And if a ſervant be oblig'd to obey his Maſter for a little nourishment, and a smal ſalary he receives; how much more a child his Mother, who nourished him with her own ſubſtance: and his Father, who laboured ſo much, to bring him up, and endeavours to provide for him?</p>
            <p n="5">5. I find in the holy ſcripture, that your obedience to be per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect, ought to have three conditions at the leaſt, it ought to be blind, cordial, and perſeverant.</p>
            <p>In the firſt place blind to the motives of the Command: It muſt propoſe no whyes, no queſtions, and no reaſons. All your why, and all your reaſon ought to be the will of your Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents repreſenting to you the will of God. <hi>Be ſubject,</hi> ſays S. Paul, <hi>in all things pleaſing, not contradicting, or murmuring.</hi> 
               <note place="margin">
                  <hi>Tit.</hi> 2. 9.</note>
            </p>
            <p>Secondly, your obedience ought to be amorous, and to proceed out of a filial heart. when you do the things commanded, out of hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane conſiderations, out of ſervil fear, or with a mercenary ſpirit, you loſe the fatte of your ſacrifice, the grace of your action, and the merit of your good worke. You muſt offer <hi>marrowie ſacrifices:</hi> you muſt obey your Superiours with a good will ſays S. Paul; with a ſincere and cordial affection: acknowledging and honouring in them the ſoveraignity of God.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, your obedience muſt be perſeverant: it muſt continue to the end of your life; 'Tis true, that Iuſtinian in his Inſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tutes: and after him other Lawyers have taught divers wayes, by which a child may be emancipated;: But there is no civil Law, nor humane power, that can free a child from the obligation he hath by this commandement, and by the Law of nature, to honor and obey his Father and Mother unto the laſt moment of his life. Wherefore Venerable Tobias thinking that <note place="margin">
                  <hi>Tob.</hi> 4. 4.</note> he should die, amongſt other admonitions which he gave his Son, ſayd to him with great tendernes, <hi>Thou shalt honor thy mother all the days of her life;</hi> Is it not then deplorable to ſee children, who during their minority, are humble, reſpectfull, and obedient to
<pb n="195" facs="tcp:108789:102"/> their parents; But being becom men or women, married, and elevated to offices, when they thinke they have no more need of them, forget and neglect, diſdain and contemn them. our Saviour does not ſo; He being elevated to the Throne of glory, to the right hand of the Father, adored by all the celeſtial Powers, forgets not his mother: He honors her more than ever, accomplishes her deſires, favours and aſſiſts thoſe who honor and invocate her, and works more miracles for the honor of her, than for the honor of his own Body; there is no King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, Nation, or Province in the Catholick world, where there are Churches or Chappells conſecrated to God, in honor of the Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin, that God does not render famous by certaine miracles.</p>
            <p n="6">6. In fine this Commandement obliges us to honor Parents, by helping, ſuccouring, and aſſiſting them. Wherefore Chriſt <note place="margin">
                  <hi>Matth.</hi> 15. <hi>S. Hierom and. S. Bede. Tim.</hi> 5. 3.</note> reprehended the Phariſees as tranſgreſſors of this Commandement, for denying them this honor. And the holy Fathers have truly noted, that the word <hi>Honour</hi> in the Scriptures, ſignifys not ſo much ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutations and profers of ſervices, as giving alms and making pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſents: <hi>Honour Widows, that are truly Widows</hi> ſays S. Paul to his diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple Timothy: that is, nourish them with alms; and recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mending to him Prieſts, <hi>Let them that rule well, eſpecially they</hi> 
               <note place="margin">
                  <hi>Tim.</hi> 5. 17.</note> 
               <hi>that labor in word and doctrine, be esteemed worthy of double honour,</hi> that is of a greater recompence or reward than others.</p>
            <p n="7">7. If then we will obſerve this Commandement, we ought not to content our ſelves with Ceremonies: we muſt not thinke it enough to ſay that we honor and reſpect our Parents: but we muſt shew it them in effect; <hi>We muſt recompence them</hi> ſays the holy Ghoſt by the mouth of Eccleſiaſticus: Them, who brought us <note place="margin">
                  <hi>Ecclus.</hi> 7. 31.</note> into the world: who have loved us ſo long, ſo cordially, and effectually. When then they are broken with old age, think it not a burden to entertain them: be not more voyd of reaſon than animals that have none: you who are humane creatures, and by your nature ought to have humanity; you who are Chriſtians, and by this quality ought to have charity, be not leſs charitable than ſtorkes that nourish their parents in old age; have not leſs piety then a pagan woman, who depriv'd her child of nou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rishment, to give it to her father: ſay no more, we have chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren:
<pb n="196" facs="tcp:108789:103"/> we fear they will want: we cannot nourish Parents with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out injuring our families; For Divinity alſo teaches you, to <note place="margin">

            <p n="8">8. To excite Children, to acquit themſelves worthily of theſe du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tyes, S. Paul propoſes three motives to them. The firſt is, that by ſo doing, they pleaſe God; and we ſee this clearly by the benedictions which God beſtows upon thoſe that are reſpectfull and obedient. But would you believe, that God worked miracles, alſo amongſt Infidells, to approve this piety of children? Ariſtotle in the book of the wonders of the world: and in the abridgment of Philoſophy which he ſent to Alexander the Great reports, that a raging fire devided and gave paſſage to a young man, that retar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded his flight, and neglected his own life, to ſave his aged father, and reunited it ſelf upon thoſe that ran before them.</p>
            <p n="9">9. On the contrary the impiety of a child is ſo abominable in the ſight of God, that in the anc<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ent Teſtament He condemn'd him to death, not only if he killed or beat, but if he curſed them, or was notably rebellious or diſobedient. <note place="margin">

            </p>
            <p n="10">10 Secondly the holy Apoſtle tells us, that it is juſt to honor them. Conſider I pray, what languishings, what faintings, what loathings, and incommodities your poor Mother ſuffered for you, whilſt She did bear you in her womb! what paines, what dangers, and what feares of death she had in bringing you into the world<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> what uneaſy nights, what toyles, what vexations she had, and what ordures, cryes, and importunities she ſuffered, to nurſe and nourish you!</p>
            <p>Conſider, what cares, what troubles, what watches, what journeys, what ſuits, what labours your poor Father hath em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braced to get and keep a few goods for you! God willing to afflict the ſon of Pharao, ſayd by Moſes to this king, I will ſend my plagues upon thy heart: becaus a father and a mother love their children as their hearts; you will be never able to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn the tenderneſſes which they had for you; when you were ſick, they were ill; when you were contented, they were joyfull: when you diſcontented, they ſorrowfull: and after ſo many te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtimonies of affection, not to love them, not to rejoyce
<pb n="197" facs="tcp:108789:103"/> them, not to comfort and content them to the utmoſt of your pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, but to be the cauſe of their ſorrow and affliction; is not this to be more cruell than Tigers, and more monſtrous than monſters themſelves?</p>
            <p n="11">11. But if your duty, and the ſtrict obligations that you have to them do not touch you: let at leaſt the love of your own ſelves, and your proper intereſt move you, through hope of the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes which God hath made you; He promiſes you long and hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py life, if you honor your Father and Mother. S. Thomas ſays, he that is gratefull for a benefit merits to have it continued <note place="margin">
                  <hi>Ephes.</hi> 6.</note> and increaſed: the child then that is gratefull for the life he hath receiv'd from his Parents, deſerves that it be polong'd and preſerv'd. If then we ſee good natured and obedient children dye young: it is that the providence of God foreſaw, that temptation would chang them, and put them in danger of damnation: and in recompence of their obedience, he gives them eternal life in lieu of temporal: <hi>He was taken away,</hi> ſays the holy <note place="margin">

Chry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoſtom anſwers: that it was not neceſſary, ſince nature does teach it clearly: and the great lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ve they have for their children does ſufficiently incline Parents to have a care of them. Whence S. Paul takes occaſion to draw this conſequence <hi>He who hath not care of his own, and eſpecially of his domeſticks is wors then an infidell;</hi> becaus he does not violate only the lawes of Chriſtia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity: but tranſgreſſes alſo the law of nature, ſo deeply imprinted in the hearts of all men. And if according to the Goſpell, they that are not more vertuous than Pagans, shal not enter into the kingdom of heaven; what ſalvation may they hope: Nay, what damnation should they not expect, who as the Apoſtle ſays, <hi>are wors than Infidells?</hi> To avoyd this then, Parents muſt pay exactly four debts they owe to children: Nourishment: Inſtruction: good Example: and Correction.</p>
            <p n="2">2. Firſt Nourishment; For Parents that deny them this debt, are not only wors then Infidells, but more unnatural and cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>el than ſavage beaſts.

There are others who fail in this firſt duty by a diſpoſition quite contrary to profuſion: by a ſpirit of avarice and unſati<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>able covetouſnes: they love ſo much their money, that they will not employ a little for the good education and ſalvation of their children; they chooſe rather to ſee them ignorant, rude, and vicious, then to disburſe money for a good Inſtructor, to ſend them to ſchool, to buy them ſpiritual books, and to make them learn ſomething in which they may profitably employ the time of their life, and improve the Talents God hath given them: in defect whereof, they are miſerable both in regard of this life and the other. they fear ſays S. Auſtin, to loſe the image of the King engraven on the money in their purs, and they fear not at all to loſe the Image of God imprinted in the ſouls of children, of whom He hath given them charge.</p>
            <p n="4">4.

Auſtin, that it is not to have care of your children, but to ſtifle them, to burden them ſo with riches gotten by the ruine of the Poore, to make them ſwim thus in the teares of widdows, and orphans, whoſe goods you hold: this will draw downe the malediction of God upon them, and upon you eternal damnation; <hi>I care not provided that he be great.</hi> Say to, him your elder Son is ignorant: he hath neither judgement nor vertue, and is uncapable of that office: if you reſigne it to him, or obtain it for him, he will do therein a thouſand injuſtices; your younger Son is not called to an Eccleſiaſtical ſtate: he hath not the gift of continence, nor any devotion; if you obtaine for him that Benefice, he will damne himſelf therein, and will damne many other: and you will be reſponſible for all; <hi>occidat modo imperet: I care not provided that he be great.</hi>

Hierom: <hi>The ſalvation of the Children, is the gain of the Parents;</hi> if you procure the ſalvation of your children, mortifying the natural tenderneſs and love you have for them, to correct their imperfections: and chooſe rather to leave them poor and low, then to enrich and raiſe them againſt Conſcience, you will gain the favour of God, He will ſay to you as to Abraham: Becaus you have been ſo faithfull to me, that you ſpared not your ſon for the love of me, I will bleſs your family, and give you a happy poſterity. And on the contrary, if you do as Hely, you will be punished as he; he was blind and feeble: he could not himſelf chaſtiſe his children: but the law of God commanded him to bring them to the Iudg: to accuſe them of their diſorders: to demand juſtice againſt them, and to make them to be condemn'd to death: and becaus he did it not, he was himſelf condemn'd; God obliges you not to ſo great ſeverity,
<pb n="203" facs="tcp:108789:106"/> but to chaſtiſe them, at leaſt when they offend him. He com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands ſo ſtrictly your children to honor you: why should you not recommend to them the render of the honor which they owe him? He punishes them ſo rigorouſly if they obey you not: why should you not punish them, when they obey not him? He ſpared not his own Son, his moſt innocent and amiable Son, He preferr'd your ſalvation before his life: Why should you ſpare your child, your ungodly, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temperate, diſſolute, and vicious child? Will you Ioſe both his and your own ſoul, to shew a fond love, or to make him great?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>The ſalvation of the children is the gain of Parents;</hi> if your chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren worke their ſalvation, you will gain repoſe: when they are prudent and vertuous, you have no diſquiet, no ſting of conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, no interiour nor exteriour trouble concerning them.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>It is the gain;</hi> you will gain honor and reputation in the world: for Parents are known by their children: the cauſe by its effects: the original by the copy; ſuch a Maſter ſuch a man: ſuch Parents, ſuch children, commonly ſpeaking.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>It is the gain of the Parents;</hi> you will gain the affection and the praiſes of your children; They will ſay after your death; Thankes be to God, who gave us Parents ſo exemplar, vigilant, and vertuous.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>It is your gain;</hi> you will gain Heaven; for S. Paul ſays, if a woman continue in faith and love, in ſanctification and ſobriety: and breed up her children in the ſame, she shal obtain ſalvation. <note place="margin">1. <hi>Tim.</hi> 2. 18.</note> Amen.</p>

To clear this point, in which the difficulty of this commandement conſiſts, and to make this diſcours beneficial: We will ſee firſt, whether or no, there was any anger in IESUS-CHRIST; Secondly, the difference of his and ours: and thirdly, the remedies of ours.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Lord rebuke me not in thy fury, nor chaſtiſe me in thy anger:</hi> ſays the Royal Prophet. Our Saviour IESUS-CHRIST, is He tranſported with fury? Is He ſubject to any paſſion, as to <note place="margin">
                  <hi>Pſal.</hi> 6.</note> make his blood boil, his eyes ſparkle, his mouth froth, to ſet his face on fire, and afterwards to make it pale: to diſorder his ſoul in her functions, and to deprive her of her empire and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand? for theſe are the proper effects, and ſymtoms of anger: which made the Stoicks, after many diſputes upon this ſubject ſay, a wiſe man, is not ſubject to theſe paſſions.</p>
            <p>It is certaine, that in our Saviour, as he is God, there is no ſuch Paſſion, for his Divinity being moſt pure, ſimple, and invariable cannot be ſubject to theſe tranſports, and alterations.</p>
            <p n="3">
               <pb n="205" facs="tcp:108789:107"/> 3. Nevertheleſs, the holy Ghoſt in the Scripture, to condeſcend to our infirmity, and to accommodate himſelf to our manner of ſpeaking and underſtanding, attributes to God many things which pertain not to him properly, but only by Analogy and likeneſs to that which is ſeen in creatures: ſo He attributes to him anger, which is no other thing in him, than his juſtice, which is called anger, becaus it hath the ſame effect as anger, but not the weakneſs and imperfection of anger. He that is angry revenges the injury receiv'd, but with tranſport and commotion: God by his juſtice punishes ſin, but with tranquillity without paſſion: <hi>Thou judgeſt with</hi> 
               <note place="margin">
                  <hi>Wiſd.</hi> 12. 18.</note> 
               <hi>tranquillity,</hi> ſays the holy Ghoſt in the book of Wiſdom.</p>
            <p n="4">4. But if we conſider JESUS-CHRIST as man, I will ſay with Divines, that the paſſions, love, hatred, choler, and joy, ſorrow, deſire, and fear, being appurtinances to humane nature certainly were in IESUS-CHRIST, as man; But without the imperfections wherewith original ſin hath ſoiled them: which hath made them in us ſtrong and vigorous, and to revolt con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinually.</p>
            <p>The Paſſions of IESUS were not ſuch: He had abſolute command over them: they were perfections, natural organs, and inſtruments which He apply'd to holy uſes. Wherefore the Saints dared not call them ſimply Paſſions, but Propaſſions, to ſignify that in this holy Soul, there were ſome diſpoſitions, which held the place of paſſions, and therefore are called propaſſions: as the Pronounes are ſo called, becaus they hold the place of Nounes: So the ſacred Hiſtorians recount that IESUS entring into the Temple, raiſed in himſelf anger, ouverthrew the tables of the Marchands, and chaſed them out as doggs, May we imitate him in this? Is it good to raiſe anger in our ſelves? ought we not to confeſs it? We need not abſolutely ſpeaking; 'tis neither vice nor imper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection, but a good action and a vertue to raiſe anger, provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded it be ſeaſoned with all neceſſary circumſtances, and like to that of IESUS. But becaus we are commonly ſo frail and ſo imper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect, that we know not how to uſe this knife without cutting our own ſelves; all things well conſidered, it is better to deprive our ſelves of it, and not be angry.</p>
            <p n="5">5. For the anger of JESUS was furnished with two conditions,
<pb n="206" facs="tcp:108789:108"/> which commonly ours does want; wherefore his was moſt vertuous and laudable: ours vicious and reproachfull. That of IESUS, never prevented or ſurprized Him: He had it not, but when, in what manner, and ſo much as He would. In in effect, 'tis ſayd in the Goſpell, <hi>that He troubled himſelf,</hi> and not that He was troubled. <note place="margin">
                  <hi>S. Iohn.</hi> 11. 13. <hi>S. Marke</hi> 14. 33.</note> And again in the Vigill of his Paſſion, <hi>He began to fear:</hi> not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, though He had a longtime the object preſent in his Spirit. Anger did not prejudice the uſe of his reaſon: it caſt no dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes, nor obſcurity into his underſtanding: it hindred him not to proceed moſt wiſely, and with entire circumſpection in his actions; His rod, ſays Hieremiah, is a watching rod, which <note place="margin">
                  <hi>Hierom.</hi> 1. 11.</note> hath open eyes, to ſee where it ſtrikes, and how it ſtrikes: his anger is a zeal, and not a paſſion, moſt reaſonable and moſt juſt. Ours on the contrary, is generally blind, inconſiderate, and rash: It prevents the judgment, and darkens reaſon, and is the cauſe we know not what we do, and that we do nothing that is good.</p>
            <p n="6">6. All that you ſay, or do in paſſion, is never well ſayd, or well don: and though you should ſpeak golden ſentences, though you should do wonders, they make no account of them: they attribute them to your paſſion<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and not to you: as they attribute to the liquor all that a man ſays or does in drink: becaus they know a man drunk with liquor or with paſſion, is uncapable to ſay or do any thing of worth; So the Civil Laws <note place="margin">
                  <hi>I. Quocqd. Si. de Reg Iur.</hi> 4. <hi>king.</hi> 3.</note> declare we ought not to regard what you ſay or do in the heat of paſſion, if you perſever not in it when your anger is allayed: Eliſeus finding himſelf moved by a juſt anger would not pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounce his Oracles, and inſtruct the Kings: but called a Mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitian to appeas firſt the commotion by the gravity of his muſick; He knew well, that a ſoul troubled with paſſion is uncapable <note place="margin">
                  <hi>Pſal.</hi> 106 27. <hi>S. Iames.</hi> 1. 20.</note> of celeſtial lights; <hi>And that anger of man works not the juſtice of God.</hi> It belongs not but to IESUS and to his holy Mother to do a thing well in the heat of paſſion.</p>
            <p n="7">7. Moreover there is a ſecond difference of his and our anger; His is never mixt with bitterneſs, nor exerciſed with a deſire of vengeance; when He is angry and punishes us, it is not out of hatred or i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>l will, 'tis out of love, or xeal of juſtice; his
<pb n="207" facs="tcp:108789:108"/> ſtrokes are favours, and his wounds are antidotes: He is an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gry as a dove, with out gaule or malice: our anger is of a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary quality, 'tis the anger of a viper, with interiour venime and black bile; when we are angry, we are full of averſion, and bitterneſs: and the malignity alſo of this viper is ſo great, that often it vomits out its poyſon againſt the goodneſs of God himſelf.</p>
            <p n="7">7. What remedy for a paſſion ſo unreasonable, maligne, and prejudicial? Firſt we muſt remove the cauſe in our own ſel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ves: muſt pull out the root, which is an inordinate affection to temporal goods, or to our ſelves, or to ſome other creature. An Ancient named Cottis broke many Veſſells which his friends had preſented him, fearing he should be angry, when his ſervants broke them; I counſell you not to deſtroy, or to quit wholy all that is, or may be the occaſion of your anger: but to mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derate your affection to them: and to love them rather out of obedience to the Will of God, than by inclination; ſo having no tye of irregular affection to them: you will not be in danger to be much moved, when you shal be depriv'd of them.</p>
            <p n="9">9. Conſider in the ſecond place from whence the accidents and Croſſes com which are wont to move your anger; Know that all that happens in this world, I ſay all, except ſin, does com from God: and therefore ought to be well receiv'd, both in regard of the divine ſource whence they proceed, and the bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficial effects, they are ſent to produce in us. The holy Ghoſt ſayes in Eccleſiaſticus <hi>that good things and evill, life and death, po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verty</hi> 
               <note place="margin">
                  <hi>Ecclus.</hi> 11. <hi>Aug. in Pſal.</hi> 48.</note> 
               <hi>and riches com from God.</hi> And hence S. Auſtin aſſures us, that whatſoever happens in this world againſt our wills, coms not but by the will of God, by his Providence and order, though we know not the reaſon of it. Whoſoever conſiders well this Providence of God, his goodneſs, and his Wiſdom, hath a true and ſweet prevention of his paſſions; he cannot thinke the Croſſes are deſign'd for ill to him becauſe, they are diſpoſed by an Infini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>te Goodneſs, who intends and projects his good; He will not Gyant like ſet up his will againſt the will of God, and with a foolish rashneſs kick againſt the ſpurr; but ſubmit to all that hath been decreed in his counſells, receive all patiently and thank<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully,
<pb n="208" facs="tcp:108789:109"/> as comming from ſo good a hand, and happily rejoyce alſo in ſo good a hope.</p>
            <p n="10">10. By theſe means well practiſed, you may prevent your anger, ſo that it will not eaſily ſurprize you; And to extin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guish it, or moderate it when it is inflam'd, your companions may by the grace of God do much, if they imitate him in a like occaſion; you ſee ſometimes a thick cloud that covers the skie, darkens the Sun, and makes as it were night at midday: you hear a thunderbolt that runs in it, lightens, thunders, and aſtonishes the world: you will ſay that all goes to rack, and the end of the world is com, What does our good God to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſipate this tempeſt? <hi>Educit ventos de the ſauris ſuis:</hi> He brings out of his treaſures a gentle weſt wind, a little wind, that diſſipates theſe clouds, calms this tempeſt, and makes the Sun to shine again; this tempeſt is reſolv'd into refreshing showers, which water the earth, and brings a thouſand commodities. When your neig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bor is in paſſion, he is like this cloud, is in a tempeſt, and in a rage: the Sun of his reaſon is ecclipſed, and hath with in him a darke night: he murmures, ſtorms, and makes a noiſe like a clap of thunder, gives looks that reſemble lightinings, threatens, rants and tears, and makes appearance of overthrowing all. If you are well diſpoſed, you will diſſipate all this eaſily; you need not but to let out of your heart, which ought to be the treaſure of God, a mild word, as a gentle wind: you muſt not diſavow any thing that he ſays at that time: you muſt not reſiſt him, nor retort a fault upon him, but excuſe him, and demand pardon, though you have not committed any fault. to mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row when this violent heat of paſſion is cooled, and his ſpirit quieted, he will return to himſelf, will admire your patience, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledg his fault, repent himſelf of his folly, and love you bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, than before.</p>
            <p n="11">11. But the ſouveraign remedy of anger and other paſſions is the grace of God. We commit great faults not making fervent and frequent recours to it. Our Saviour had no need to pray: and yet to give us example, being neer his paſſion, ſayd to his Father, <hi>My ſoul is troubled; my fother ſave me from this houre:</hi> Do <note place="margin">
                  <hi>Iohn.</hi> 12. 27.</note> as He: when you percieve any temptation in your heart<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> caſt

How narrow is the gate, and ſtrait is the way that lead</hi>

            </p>
            <p>But if I leave the uſuall way of men, what will they ſay? I shal paſs for a ſcrupulous, a melancholy perſon, or a hypocrite, and they will laugh at me. And who will laugh at you? Libertines, Impious, and Atheiſts; but God, Angells, and vertuous Perſons will eſteem and praiſe you. Will it not be much honor to you, to be blam'd by thoſe that are worthy of blame, and to be eſteem'd by thoſe who merit to be eſteem'd? The conſcience alſo of Liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tines themſelves will be forced to admire what their mouth con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demnes;

            <p>But ſuppoſe, that you are really laught at and derided. What vertuous Perſon hath not paſſed this tryal? Tobias and Iob, were they not mocked, as Idiots and ſimple men? S. Charles, did he not paſs amongſt worldly ſoule<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

Granado and Avila for ſcrupulous? and what is moſt conſiderable, the Saint of Saints IESVS-CHRIST, hath he not paſſed for a foole or madman, for a friend of good cheer, for a hlaſphemer and for a magitian? We muſt then have the courage, ſayes great S. Francis Sales, to make the world know by our manner of living, that we are not of this world, but the ſervants of God, that the lights of the Goſpell, and not the maximes and the cuſtoms of the world, are the rules of our life; ſo we shal tye the tongues of the impudent: and draw many to the ſame manner of living, by the examples of our vertues. Let us after this not unprofitable digreſſion, return to the definition.</p>
            <p n="5">5. <hi>Dictum, vel factum, a word or action.</hi> In this word <hi>Action,</hi> is couched <hi>Omiſſion:</hi> when you can do an action which would hinder the offence of God, and you do it not. IESVS being required to pay tribute, declares himſelf not oblig'd, and nevertheleſs he pay'd it, leſt He should ſcandalize the farmers. So the Virgin circumciſed her Son, and ſubmitted herſelf to the law of purification, for fear of giving ill example. So S. Paul ſays, the Ancient Philoſophers having known the true God by the light of nature: and having not communicated this knowledg to the reſt of men, to draw them from Idolatry, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curr'd the anger of God, and were guilty of all ſins the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple committed for want of that knowledg. We are then culpa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, when we ought to correct, reprehend, or punish the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects of others, and do not: we ſcandaliſe them: for they ſay, there is no ill in this, my Parents, Confeſſor, Superior, ſay no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing to me of it.</p>
            <p n="6">6. <hi>Minus rectum.</hi> This word teaches us that if an action be
<pb n="114" facs="tcp:108789:112"/> good and laudable, commanded by God or his Church, we ought not to omit it, though our neighbor be ſcandalized by it; if one is ſcandalized when you ſay the truth, 'tis better to permit ſcandal then to oppoſe Verity ſays S. Gregory; Tis a Phariſaical ſcandal, a <note place="margin">

               </note> paſſive ſcandal, not an active, a ſcandal taken not given.</p>
            <p n="7">7. And if the action be good and laudable, but not of obliga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion: ought we to omit it, if one will be ſcandalized by it? S. Thomas anſwers learnedly with a diſtinction. either our nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ghbour is ſcandalized maliciouſly and out of a ſpirit of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradiction: <note place="margin">2. 2. <hi>q.</hi> 43. <hi>ar.</hi> 7.</note> or is ſcandaliſed through ignorance, or infirmity; if he be ſcandaliſed maliciouſly; we ought not to omit our good worke; for 'tis his own fault, and not ours. He does as the Phareſees, who were ſcandalized maliciouſly by the predications of IESUS; But IESUS contemn'd their ſcandal, and left not off his prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching. If he be ſcandalized through ignorance, or through weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs: 'tis better to do your good worke in private, or to omit it for a time, than to give an occaſion to your neighbor to fall into any ſin. And with much more reaſon, if the action be of it ſelf indifferent, neither good, nor evill, charity obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges us to omit it, when it would be an occaſion of ſin, or temptation to our neighbor. If you offend your neighbor giving him occaſion of ſin through his weakneſs, you offend our Lord: and therefore <hi>If I know my brother is ſcandalized to ſee me eate flesh, I will never eate it, leſt I ſcandalize my hrother,</hi> ſays S. Paul. <note place="margin">1. <hi>Cor.</hi> 8. 12. <hi>Rom.</hi> 14. 15. 20.</note> And again, <hi>do not with thy meat deſtroy him, for whom</hi> CHRIST <hi>dyed. Deſtroy not the worke of God for meat.</hi> Though then an action be permitted, if it be not commanded, we muſt abſtain from it, if it be a ſnare or ſtumblingblock to infirme and weak ſoules.</p>
            <p n="8">8. <hi>Prebens alicui: giving occaſion to our neighbor.</hi> Some may ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin, that 'tis not to be ſcandalous, if they do not a publick action, which is manifeſt to many. But our Saviour ſays, if you move <note place="margin">
                  <hi>Matt.</hi> 18.</note> to ſin but one only, you are ſcandalous. You ſay, they are ſimple and weak people, that are tempted by ſuch an action or ſuch a word: the wiſe and well grounded in vertue are not mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved by it; IESUS ſays you muſt not ſcandalize one of the leſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſer ones, <hi>unum de puſillis;</hi> and S. Paul tells us that in ſcan dalizing the weak ones, we ſin againſt IESUS-CHRIST; And
<pb n="115" facs="tcp:108789:112"/> the Son of God adds: <hi>Voe mundo a ſcandalis,</hi> Woe to the world for ſcandalls; He Speakes ſo, becaus the world is full of them; and becaus they deſtroy ſo many ſouls, ſo dear and precious to him.</p>
            <p n="9">9. It ſeems that ſoules are more dear to IESUS than his in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nocent blood; He willed it should be prophan'd, and trod under feet, for the ranſome of theſe beloved ſoules. I leave you to think, what punishment, and what reproches we shal receive from him: if by our bad exemple, or by our negligence, we let any one of theſe ſoules fall into ſin, and damnation?</p>
            <p>Believe, that in the houre of your death, nothing will cauſe you more regret: nor afflict you more, than the ſight of the ſoules which by your fault are loſt; You will acknowledg this truth, and feel the weight of theſe dreadfull words: <hi>Vae homini illi per quem ſcandalum venit:</hi> woe to the perſone by whom <note place="margin">

            <p>You will ſee all the graces God had given to ſoules through your fault loſt: all the merits they had gotten: all that our Saviour did and ſuffered for their ſalvation: and you will with ſorrow, and ſighing ſay; Ha! I have deſtroy'd ſoules for which JESUS CHRIST dyed; how shal I reſtore to him the blood which He hath shed? <hi>vae homini illi:</hi> wo be to that perſon! It were better for you one had tyed a milſtone about your neck and thrown you into the Sea.</p>
            <p>You will ſee the excellency and the value of the ſoules you have caſt away: and this will oppreſs you with griefe, as if you had a milſtone upon your heart.</p>
            <p>You will ſee that thoſe who learnt of you the vanities of the world, will teach their children them: theſe will derive them to their deſcendents unto the third or fourth generation, all wh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ich will be imputed to you: this ſight will caſt you even into deſpaire.</p>

               <seg rend="decorInit">A</seg>mongſt all the irregular motions of a man, there is none more contrary to his nature, nor more abo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minable to the Creatour, than the unhappy vice of carnality. It is contrary to mans nature: becaus it is beaſtly, terreſtrial, and unworthy of a man; In anger, en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vy, pride. ambition there is ſome kind of ſpirit; But luxury clouds the underſtanding: depreſſes the faculties of the ſoul: renders her unable to elevate her ſelf above the objects of ſenſe, and impaires all that is manly in us.</p>
            <p n="2">2. This vice is abominable to God, who repented to have made man, and ſent a deluge to drowne the earth; who conſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in'd by fire four of the moſt florishing cityes of the world: and ſlautered 24 thouſand of his people at one time: and 60 thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand at another, in punishment of this ſin.</p>
            <p>Though this vice be ſo contrary to a man, and ſo abomina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to God: Yet fails it not to be moſt general; For tis the ſource of an abundance of ſins; of an abundance in regard of the divers Species of it; of an abundance in reſpect of the indi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viduums or particulars.</p>
            <p n="3">
               <pb n="217" facs="tcp:108789:113"/> 3. There is no kind of vice that hath ſo many Circumſtances which chang the Species or kinds, as this. The other common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly have but three or four at moſt: this hath ſeven; which we muſt expreſs in confeſſion, if we have fallen into them, either in effect or will.</p>
            <p>The firſt ſpecies or kind is <hi>ſimple Fornication:</hi> when you are not married, and do ill with a perſone that is not bound, neither by Vow, nor marriage; And though this be the leaſt crime a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt the ſpecies of this vice: 'tis nevertheleſs a mortall ſin; for S. Paul declares to us at leaſt three times, that this ſin ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cludes <note place="margin">1. <hi>Cor.</hi> 6. <hi>Gal.</hi> 5. <hi>Ephes.</hi> 7. 5.</note> us out of the kingdom of Heaven.</p>
            <p n="5">5. The ſecond is <hi>Stupration:</hi> when yon defloure or dishonour a Virgin; you ruine in her ſoul the grace of God, which is the greateſt good she can have in this world: and in her body a pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious treaſure, the loſs of which is the more deplorable, becaus it is irreparable.</p>
            <p n="6">6. The Third is <hi>Inceſt,</hi> when 'tis with any of your Relations, by blood, or by affinity, unto the fourth degree incluſively.</p>
            <p n="7">7. The fourth is <hi>Adultery:</hi> when you are married, or do ill with a perſone that is bound in marriage: a ſin, which vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lates divine, natural, and humane Lawes: a ſin, which Pagans, ot Infidells themſelves have punished with death or exquiſite tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments: ſome by fire, others by wild horſes: ſome by the halter: others in pulling out their eyes: cutting off their noſes: and in the law of Moſes it was punished by ſtones: ſo great appears this diſorder by the light of nature, and ſo enormous in the ſight of God.</p>
            <p n="8">8. Nevertheleſs this ſin is now incomparably more black and criminal than it was in the law of Moſes, or in that of nature; For you break as much as lies in you the indiſſoluble bond of marriage: you violate a bond which repreſents the Vnion of IESUS CHRIST with his Church; 'Tis as if you ſayd that JESUS <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>ath divorſed the Church his Spouſe: or that his Spouſe hath quitted him<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> notwithſtanding his promiſes to the contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry.</p>
            <p>More yet: the bodyes of Chriſtians are worthy of honour, and ought to be treated with reſpect and reverence, not only becaus
<pb n="218" facs="tcp:108789:114"/> they are the members of Chriſt, and Temples of the holy Ghoſt: but moreover, becaus they have been ſanctifyd by Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſme: by the ſacred Chriſme in Confirmation: by the moſt holy Body of JESUS in Communion: by being the matter of a Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament, which S. Paul calls Great: and by the nuptial bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction when they married; And they ſoil them by adulteries, proſtitute them as prophane things, to black, infamous, shamefull, and abominable actions; Wherefore the Emperours Conſtantine, Conſtantius, and Conſtance ſons of the great Conſtantine, publi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shed an Edict againſt adulterers, condemning them to the punish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of paricides: which was to be butnt, or drown'd, becaus ſay they, ſuch are, <hi>ſacriligi nuptiarum,</hi> abuſers and prophaners of marriage.</p>
            <p n="9">9. The fift Species of this Vice is <hi>Rape:</hi> when you force one: or you draw conſent by deceits, lyes, promiſes, or perſwaſions ſo powerfull, that they are equivalent to conſtraint.</p>
            <p n="10">10. The ſix is <hi>Sacriledge:</hi> when you commit an impurity be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a perſone ſacred by ſolemne or particular Vow, or by holy Orders: or when you permit ſuch a perſone to take carnal pleaſure in you: 'tis in ſome manner to rob him, if it could be, of conſecration: 'tis the higheſt pitch of malice in the matter of fornication, ſayes S.

            <p n="11">11. The ſeventh in fine is the ſin againſt <hi>nature:</hi> which is ſo abominable, that we name it not, and which nevertheleſs is committed ſometimes alſo amongſt married perſones. Remember that S. Briget did ſee in extaſie many married people in hell, for having abuſed marriage. Remember what S.

            </p>
            <p>Confeſſours are very reſerv'd, and ought to be ſo in this mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of carnality; Preachers and good Writers treat ſparingly of ſuch ſubjects: leſt the very articulate ſound or characters in this matter should offend chaſt eares: or cauſe wors effects in the hearts of others; if than you do not help your ſelves: if you
<pb n="219" facs="tcp:108789:114"/> confeſs not theſe ordures, unleſs you be examin'd you may remain in them 'til death.</p>
            <p n="12">12. Theſe are the ſeven heads of this Monſter: ſeven heads by which we may ſin by this Vice; But the Individuums or parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culars of it are infinite. There is no kind of vice wherein men commit ſo great a number of mortal ſins, as in this vice of Luxury; a Drunkard is not drunk, but once, or twice a day: a Robber robbs not every day: a murtherer kills not very often: But he that gives himſelf over to impurity, commits dozens of mortal ſins a day; it happens very often, that he takes delight interiourly, ten, twelve, or twenty times a day in impure ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects: and the voluntary delectation is a ſin: though he has no will to do it in effect.</p>
            <p n="13">13. Wherefore I would counſell him that is a ſlave to this Paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, to make to himſelf the ſame reply, which heretofore the Buffoon or Ieſter of Francis the firſt of France did make; The King having aſſembled his Counſell, to deliberate what way was beſt to go to Pavie: ſome ſayd one way: others another: and others a third; the Buffoon, who heard all behind the tapeſtry, when they were gon, cryed-out: they have all conſulted by which way the King shal go: but they have not conſider'd by what way he shal return! And the event made appeare it had been an important counſell; for the King was there made priſoner. When temptation flatters the hearts of them: they conſult not, but of the means to content it: and how they may find a fit occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion to ſatisfy their paſſion; But they conſider not, how they may get out of the inconveniences, which they bring upon themſelves by it; they conſider not, the certaine loſs of ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual life, the danger of the temporall, and of their fame: and that by begetting illegitimate children, they deprive unjuſtly the legitimate, and oblige themſelves to reſtitutions, which will be very hardly made. Theſe things well conſider'd, will be a bridle to their paſſion: and make them alſo fly thoſe converſations, diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſitions, affections, and occaſions of falling into a ſnare ſo prejudicial, and into a labyrinth ſo inextricable, for we muſt fight in this war, as the Parthians flying: and therefore S. Paul bids

            <p n="3">3. Who is he whom the ſcripture terms covetous? ſayd S. Baſil, and after him S. Ambroſe; He ſay they, who is not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent with that which ought to be enough. And S. Auſtin decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>res, that not only he who takes the goods of another: but he that keeps his own with avidity is covetous. And the ſame Saint makes us note, that all the Rich that are damn'd and declar'd ſuch in the Goſpell, were not Vſurpers of other mens goods: but only too greedy and tenacious of their own. Wherefore the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle writing to his Diſciple Timothy charges him, <hi>to command the rich of this world, not to truſt in the incertainty of riches, but in the living God; to do well, to becom rich in good workes, to give ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſily, to communicate their wealth to thoſe that want, to heap unto themſelves a good foundation for the time to com, that they may obtain the true life.</hi> We ſee then that avarice is pernicious, though it prevail not ſo far with us as to make us to commit injuſtice; which effect avarice ſo frequently produces, that the earth is filled with it: though injuſtice does oblige to perfect Reſtitution: and this be hard and very rare. You will avow theſe verities, if you con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider with me the Definition which Doctors give of Robbery.</p>
            <p n="4">4. They ſay; that <hi>tis to take, or retain, or to endammage the
<pb n="223" facs="tcp:108789:116"/> goods of another againſt the will of him to whom it belongs. Tis to take:</hi> either by your ſelf, or by others: either ſecretly and by theft, or openly by force, exacting, receiving, or permitting others to exact, or to receive what is not due to you; as when you exact four<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shillings for marchandiſe, or ſervice, which is not worth three.</p>
            <p n="5">5. <hi>To take or retain;</hi> Not only to take, but to retain that which is not yours is robbery. If you inherit goods ill gotten by your Father or by your Anceſters, if you owe any thing to others: if you have found that which another loſt: by retaining it you commit robbery; There is no great difference ſayd Pope Inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent the third in the Lateran Councel as to the danger of the ſoul, betwixt unjuſt detention, and invaſion of anothers goods.</p>
            <p n="6">6. <hi>Or Endammage;</hi> if you damnify your neighbor in his corne, or other thing; if you thruſt your ſelf into an office, Trade, or other employment of which you are uncapable, and are the cauſe through your ignorance that any one be preiudiced in health or other good, you commit robbery.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>To good of another;</hi> underſtand ether ſpiritual, or corporal: which is not pondered and conſidered enough by ſome. If you have deſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>royd your neighbors houſe, you are judg'd a Robber: you are obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>g'd to make Satisfaction; you have made a horrible deſtruction in his ſoul: you deſtroy'd in his heart the treaſures of the grace of God, ſoliciting him to ſin, and you reflect not on it: you thinke not to put again into a good way this unhappy ſoul which you have made to ſtray; you are a robber.</p>
            <p n="8">8. They add in the definition, <hi>againſt the will of him to whom it belongs:</hi> that is to ſay, without his voluntary and abſolute free conſent; For though he conſent to it, if he conſent unwillingly: if he does wish it otherwiſe: if his conſent be any ways extorted either by force, or fear: it excuſes you not from robbery; for there is nothing ſo contrary to a free conſent as force, or fear. He then is a robber, who to do juſtice to a Party that hath right, receives a bribe or preſent. He is a robber who wearyes a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother with ſuits and expences, to the end he quit that which he may pretend to juſtly. He is a robber who makes his dependents to do him ſervices, to which they are not oblig'd, w<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>thout paying them well for them. He is a robber, who forces his Creditors to
<pb n="224" facs="tcp:108789:117"/> compoſition, for fear of inconveniences which he may bring upon them: becaus the conſent to theſe, and the like actions, is not free and voluntary. ſo far theſe palliated injuſtices are from being juſtifiable in the ſight of God: that on the contrary they add to ſimple theft a circumſtance which changes the ſpecies of it, and which is called <hi>Rapine.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="9">9. To have a horrour of theſe, and the like diſorders: Conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der that this vice engages you in an ocean of ſins, and precipi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tates you in a manner-irreperably, into eternal damnation. For tis not ſo in this ſin as in others: You are not quit of it by repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting, confeſſing, and doing penance for it: it obliges moreover to <hi>Reſtitution;</hi> And ſee here, what Divines ſay of it.</p>
            <p n="10">10. They teach us in the firſt place, that reſtitution is an act of commutative Iuſtice, and conſequently that there muſt be an equality between the dammages which you have cauſed, and the reparation which you make of it; In Vindicative Iuſtice, if mercifully you relax a little the rigour of the Law: if you ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ke not the greatneſs of the pain preciſely equal to the grievouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of the crime, the mercy of God excuſes eaſily your fault; But in Commutative Iuſtice, if having ſtolen 50. shillings, you reſtore but 48. you are ſtil a theef.</p>
            <p n="11">11. Secondly, they aſſure us, that <hi>Reſtitution</hi> is neceſſary to ſalvation; that without it ſorrow, confeſſion, and abſolution are unprofitable, that nothing can excuſe you from it, but only im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſibility to make it.</p>
            <p n="12">12. But to reſtore all muſt I fall from my eſtate and Conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on? You are oblig'd to it; having built your fortune upon the ruine of your neighbour, it is moſt reaſonable you repair that of your neighbour, by the ruine of yours; ought not the condition of the Innocent to be better then that of the Criminal?</p>
            <p n="13">13. But I cannot make reſtitution without defaming my ſelf; for he to whom J shal reſtore, will ſee that I have injured him and will decry me. You muſt give it in this caſe to your Confe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſſor, or to a faithfull friend, who may render it without naming any perſonne, take an acquittance of him, and shew it to you. that you may be ſure of your diſcharg, from this obligation; an obligation ſo ſtrict, that no power on earth can free you from it.
<pb n="225" facs="tcp:108789:117"/> Death it ſelf, which diſſolves conſummate marriage, delivers you not from it; and if God should raiſe you up again, you would not be oblig'd to retake your wife: but you would be to pay your debts: and your heires ought to do it in your defect.</p>
            <p n="14">14 Divines inform us further, that not only he who does an injury, but moreover all that cooperate or concurre to it are oblig'd to Reſtitution: as Receivers, fals Witneſſes, makers of antidates, and fals contracts: Counſellours, who counſell you to proſecute a ſuit which they know to be uniuſt: or they, who by notable negligence make their Clients loſe a juſt one: and Notaries who by ignorance or malice change the intention of the Teſtatour.</p>
            <p n="15">15. Infine they conclude that this commandement obliges always and inceſſantly; becaus it is not an affirmative precept only that commands us to reſtore: but alſo a negative, that forbids us to retaine: and as ſuch it is expreſſed commonly by negative terms in the Bible. 'Tis the property of negative commandements to oblige always, and for always; and therefore we ſin at leaſt ſo often, as the thought of paying, ſatisfying, reſtoring, coms into our minds, if having power, we neglect it.</p>
            <p n="16">16. Do better, injure no man, commit not ſins which oblige to reſtitution; for you will make it, or not; if you make it, you will have contracted ſin, and obligation to punishment, without receiving the profit of it: ſince you muſt reſtore the principal, and make good all prejudice and dammage; and if you make it not, being in capacity to make it, you are un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don, you are loſt for ever.</p>
            <p n="17">17. If then you have been ſo unfortunate as to oblige your ſelves to it; doe as a rich man of our age, who going from a Sermon, diſtributed his goods to thoſe he had injured, ſaying, <hi>Pereant mihi, ne ego Peream: may I loſe theſe goods, leſt I loſe my ſelf;</hi> theſe goods are for the earth, my ſoul is for heaven: theſe goods are perishable, my ſoul is immortal: theſe goods will ſtay here, my ſoul will go with me; they will be the poſſeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of my heires, my ſoul will be my owne; theſe are not true goods however great and abundant they be, ſince they make not good ſo many bad men that poſſeſs them: they are not true
<pb n="226" facs="tcp:108789:118"/> riches ſince they make not rich nor content thoſe that are flaves to them: I muſt leave them one day neceſſarily, and without merit, tis better then that I quit them now voluntarily, and with merit.</p>
            <p n="18">18. This good man did very well to cure his wounds: But I adviſe you, by flying avarice which was the cauſe of them, to prevent all wounds. Hear then what the holy Ghoſt hath ſayd of it: <hi>Nothing is more wicked than to love money.</hi> Hear our Saviour, <note place="margin">

               <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg>F the fifth commandement ougth to be much reſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected, becaus it forbids us to aſſault the life of our neighbour: and the ſixth, which forbids us to dishonour his wife: and the ſeventh which pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hibits us to ſteal, or to hurt him in his goods: with more reaſon the eighth commandement ought to be looked upon as of the greateſt im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portance, ſince it forbids fals witneſs, which makes our neighbor often loſe his life, ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour, temporall goods, and ſometimes alſo his ſpirituall. To han<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle this ſubject fully, and to make it more univerſall, we will conſider three ſins or falſities which oppoſe this commandement: falſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties of heart, which are rash judgments: falſities of mouth, which are lyes: falſities of workes or actions, which are cheats or impoſtures.</p>
            <p n="1">1. An Ancient ſayd that there is no art nor occupation of which ſo many make profeſſion as that of Phiſitians; ſo ſoon as you com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plain of the toothake, collick, or gravel, you will find fourty, who preſcribe you remedies, all as they think very effectual, all or the moſt part in effect very unprofitable. that Ancient had hitt better yet, had he ſa<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

               <note place="margin">
                  <hi>S. Iohn.</hi> 7. 24.</note> 
               <hi>judg according to the exteriour appearance.</hi> In which words our Saviour
<pb n="228" facs="tcp:108789:119"/> expreſſes 3. circumſtances which are neceſſary to make rash judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment a mortal ſin in a matter of importance.</p>
            <p n="2">2. In the firſt place 'tis neceſſary that a judgment be voluntary and deliberate, for if it be but a thought, and a promptitude, which we renounce when we perceive it, 'tis not a ſin; IESUS ſayd not, do not judg: but he ſayd, <hi>will not to judg;</hi> It is not in our power not to judg by a ſudden motion: but 'tis in our power, not to conſent to this judgment, and to caſt it out of our mind.</p>
            <p n="3">3. In the ſecond place: 'tis not a mortall ſin when one judges not abſolutely, but doubts only of a thing: makes not a form'd and fixt judgment: but ſuſpects only: he ſays not in himſelf, ſurely it is ſo: but it may be ſo: I fear leſt it be ſo; And IESUS did not ſay, <hi>ſuſpect not.</hi> He nevertheleſs who should ſuſpect voluntarily of a Prelate, or ſuch like perſons an evill of great im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portance, I know not, if one may excuſe him from a mortal ſin.</p>
            <p n="4">4. In the third place, 'tis not a mortall ſin, nor alſo often ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nial, when you judg of that which cannot be palliared, nor ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſed by any reaſon: if you ſee a man kill his neighbor: to do ill with a married woman: to blaſpheme the holy name of God: 'tis not a rash judgment to thinke that he is a murtherer, an adulterer, a blaſphemer; but to judg upon weak appearances, is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to the word of the Son of God: <hi>judg not according to appea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance;</hi> It is an evill effect, which proceeds from divers cauſes, and all bad and vicious; 'tis ſometimes lightnes and emptines of ſpirit; when one hath not good entertainments within himſelf, nor in his own houſe, he ſeeks entertainments without himſelf, wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders about in companies, cannot be mute in them, tells newes, hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>res other, knowes not enough, invents more.</p>
            <p n="5">5. An Ancient in Plautus, compares them to waſpes: which make no hony, buzz inceſlantly, fly up and down, upon Altars, Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, Crownes, and leave nothing but filth upon them: ſo thoſe Idlebees droanes and lazie people, who know not how to employ themſelves, paſs their time in judging and detracting Prelats, Kings, Iudges, Prieſts, Religions: and ſince they are light, and
<pb n="229" facs="tcp:108789:119"/> shallow, they believe eaſily all that comes into their mind, with never ſo little appearance, be it good or evill.</p>
            <p n="6">6. S Paul teaches us another cauſe of rash judgments: the defect of charity: 'Tis becaus you have in your heart ſome ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cret envy, bitterneſs, or averſion from your neighbour: <hi>Charity thinks not ill,</hi> ſays the Apoſtle; there needs no other proof of it than experience. If a perſonne that you love well did the actions which you cenſure in your enemy, or corrival, you would not judg them criminall, as you do thoſe of others: you would in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpret them in a good ſenſe. As he that looks through a red glaſs, all that he ſees ſeems to him red: ſo you judg the actions of your neighbor according to the paſſion of love or hatred you have for him.</p>
            <p>We believe eaſily what we deſire and ſee willingly, ſays S. Thomas; You have no repugnance, but great inclination to believe the vice of your neighbor, becaus you wish him ill: becaus you are ſubject to the crimes, and imperfections which you imagin to be in him; <hi>The foole conceives that all others are like himſelf,</hi> ſays the holy Ghoſt by the mouth of the wiſe man. <note place="margin">
                  <hi>Eccl.</hi> 10. 15.</note> And again: <hi>the heart of a wiſe man is in his right ſide, and that of a fool in the left;</hi> It is certen, that all men have the heart in the ſame place: but He does ſignify, that a vertuous man jud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges in good part the actious of all men: the ill man meaſures every one by his own ell: he makes ſiniſter judgements of the moſt part of men; the Bee drawes hony from the moſt bitter flowers: the cantharides makes poyſon of the moſt ſweet; the ſame raine fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling upon a Vine is changed into pleaſant and wholſome wine <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

            <p n="7">7. And from thence comes the bad effects which theſe rash judgments produce againſt God, our neighbors, and our ſelves. 'Tis to uſurp the office of the Son of God and to do him in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jury: ſince the Father hath given to him all judgment: Note <hi>all;</hi>

               </note> S. Paul looking upon it as a horrible uſurpation, cryes-out: <hi>Who art thou that juggeſt another mans ſervant? To his own Lord he ſtands or falls.</hi> 'Tis likewiſe to be injurious to our neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bor:
<pb n="230" facs="tcp:108789:120"/> For 'tis detraction and injuſtice to ruine his reputation, though it be in the opinion of one man only; but when you judg ill of your neighbour upon weake conjectures, you ruine his reputation in your ſelf; you do to another, that which you would not have don to you; you do as the Phariſee who diſdai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>n'd another only within himſelf, and the Son of God reprehends him for it. In fine you do not only injure God, and your neighbour by rash judgments, but you hurt much alſo your own ſelf, for they fill you with pride, vanity, iealouſy, ſuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>picion, unquietneſs, and contempt of your neighbour.</p>
            <p n="8">8. S. Bernard gives us for a remedy of theſe judgments a moſt ſalutary advice. If you ſee your neighbor to do ill, think perhaps he does it with a good intention, or out of ignorance, or through great weakneſs, and without malice, or that he was ſurprized; but if the action be ſo black, that it admits none of theſe excuſes, think it was à very ſtrong and violent temptation that made him fall, and ſay within your ſelf, if God had permit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted the like to have aſſaulted me, perhaps J had yielded to it as well as he: perhaps he hath many great vertues, which counter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>balance the fault which he committed: perhaps this fall makes him very humble, and that by his humility, he is more pleaſing to God, than you by your proud Innocence: and when nothing of all this should be: how know you what will becom of you, and what will becom of him; there is inconſtancy and weakneſs enough in your heart to make you one day, one of the greateſt ſinners in the world: and there is power and mercy enough in the heart of God, to make this ſinner becom one day, a moſt great Saint in heaven.</p>
            <p n="9">9, The ſecond ſort of falſities which this commandement forbids are thoſe of the mouth; and men are accuſtomed to ſpeak them in three manners; Firſt in injuring their neighbour, as when they teſtify that he hath rob'd or kill'd: and this lye is called, <hi>hurt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full, or pernicious.</hi> ſecondly, in pleaſuring your neighbour: as when you ly, to deliver him out of ſome perill: and this is called <hi>a ſerviceable or officious ly.</hi> Thirdly, in neither hurting, nor ay<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ding; and this is called, <hi>a vain or idle ly.</hi> There are many<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> alſo of thoſe that make profeſſion of vertue, who deteſt fals witneſs
<pb n="231" facs="tcp:108789:120"/> and pernicious lyes: but make no difficulty of idle, and officious; they conſider not that the holy Ghoſt diſtinguishes a ly from falſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>witneſs, and ſays that both diſpleas God. <note place="margin">
                  <hi>Prov.</hi> 6. 16. 2. 2. <hi>q.</hi> 110. <hi>S. Greg. lib.</hi> 18. <hi>mor: cap.</hi> 4.</note>
            </p>
            <p>S. Thomas concluds, that we ought not to ly, for to ſave a man. S. Gregory ſayd the ſame, ſpeaking of officious lyes. S. Auguſtine who wrote whole books upon this ſubject, goes far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther yet, and ſays, that one ought not to ly, for to procure the ſalvation of our neighbour: <hi>ad ſempiternam vitam nullus ducendus est opitulante mendacio.</hi> And to the objection which ſome propoſe of the Egiptian midwives who kylled not the Children of the Iſraelites, as Pharo had commanded, and excuſed themſelves by lyes, the ſcripture adding that God rewarded them. S. Gregory anſwers, that they were not recompenced for their ly, but for their Piety.</p>
            <p>And as to the Patriarke Iacob, and other Saints who ſeem in the ſcripture to have ſpoke untruths: the hoy Fathers anſwer, that they were myſteryes, not lyes, becaus they ſpoke not in their own perſone, but in the perſonne of thoſe, of whom they were the figure.</p>
            <p n="10">10. Officious lyes oblige us to the paines of Purgatory: but pernicious to the paines of hell; <hi>The mouth that lyeth kills the ſoul,</hi> ſays the holy Ghoſt it brings damnation moſt due to them who are ſo injurious both to God and man.</p>
            <p n="11">11. In fine the third ſort of falſities forbidden, are frauds, circumventions, diſſimulations, and hypocriſies; Theſe are ſo common in the world that if the Prophet Hieremie were in this age, he would ſay of it, what he ſayd of his, <hi>That our houſes are fall of guile.</hi> In the houſes of great ones, what chringing, ſupple<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, and treachery to ſupplant others? in the Courts of juſtice what injurious judgments, what ſuperfluous delayes, what un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juſt appeals! In the shops of marchands, and tradeſmen, what frauds, what fals weights and meaſures, what fals coyne, what corrupted and ſophiſticated marchandiſe! To be short, in the Churches themſel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ves, what counterfeit devotions, what diſguiſed confeſſions, what hypocritical communions!</p>
            <p n="12">12. This Vice is ſo deteſtable, that the ſacred Text joyns it with homicide; God will abominate the murtherer and the
<pb n="232" facs="tcp:108789:121"/> the Deceiver, ſays the Royal Prophet; And you will not find <note place="margin">
                  <hi>Pſal.</hi> 7.</note> that the Son of God ſayd a word ſo sharp and nipping, of any abſent perſone, as He did of Herod, ſaying that he was a fox, becaus he was a Deceiver? <hi>Dicite vulpi illi.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="13">13. Let us end this diſcours with three powerfull paſſages of of Scripture, and three reaſons againſt theſe vices.</p>

               <hi>Thou shat not bear fals witneſs againſt thy neighbour.</hi>
            </head>
            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">A</seg>S detraction is a very dangerous and common Vice: ſo it ſeems commonly forbidden. Some ſay, that 'tis forbidden by the fift comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dement, <hi>Thou shalt not kill:</hi> becaus it takes away our civill life, by which we live in the good opinion of men. Others ſay that 'tis for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bidden by the ſeventh. <hi>Thou shalt not ſteal:</hi> becaus it robs men of their fame and good name. Others in fine will have it forbidden by the eighth: becaus this, ſay they, forbids all injuries, that we do to the goods, to the honor and reputation, or the perſon of our neighbour by our unruly tongue; all which does shew what a pernicious ſin this is; which kills, robs, and injures ſo much our neighbour; And yet, as I ſayd, 'tis a moſt common vice, becaus Detractours want not ſpecious pretexts, nor excuſes which ſeem legitimate to palliate and plaiſter it. Wherefore in this diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cours I firſt lay open the nature of it, and unmaske it; In the ſecond place, I put before your eyes its bad effects; and in the third place, remedies.</p>
            <p>Calumnie, ſays S. Thomas, is to accuſe our neighbor falſly of a ſin which he hath not committed; And detraction is to declare a fin which he hath committed, or a notable imperfection
<pb n="234" facs="tcp:108789:122"/> that is in him. This is not ſo great a ſin as calumny, But it is a great one. When a thing is manifeſt: if it be known to the moſt of the Town or neighbourhood and cannot be concealed: if you ſpeak of it, it is not a mortal ſin; But if the thing be ſecret or known to few: if you reveal it to them that know nothing of it you do againſt charity and juſtice: and therefore you are oblig'd to reſtitution. The light of nature, and this maxime of IESUS teaches you this truth, <hi>Do not to another, What you would not have don to your ſelf.</hi> If your daughter, ſiſter, or kinſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>woman has committed a fault your neigbour ſeeing it, would you he should reveal it? or he to whom he hath reveal'd it should publish it, and ſay for excuſe; I did not invent it: ſuch a perſon ſaw it: I relate it as I heard it; would you not be trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled and griev'd notwithſtanding this excuſe? Why then do you to another what you would not have don to your ſelf?</p>
            <p n="4">4. There are other yet more malicious: they make shew that what they ſay, coms from compaſſion, and neverthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs it coms out of paſſion. Our Saviour ſayd: <hi>Take heed of them who com to you in the cloathing of sheep, and are inwardly ravinous</hi> 
               <note place="margin">
                  <hi>Matt.</hi> 7. 10.</note> 
               <hi>wolves;</hi> we may ſay again, who com to you with the voice of sheep, who prayſe the abſent, and afterward do as wolves; with our doubt, ſay they, he is one of the fineſt men of his pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion in the world; But he forgot himſelf very much: he is much to be pitied: he would have don very well: 'tis a great miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortune: I ſay it with a feeling; It was no fault of mine he did not avoyd that: I have often admonished him of it; they give poyſon ſweetned with hony: they have the voice of sheep, but the teeth of wolves.</p>
            <p n="4">4. And in effect they hurt and kill three perſons with one bite. Firſt themſelves; for their detraction deprives them of the life of grace, and kills them ſpiritually: it being a mortal ſin, in a matter of importance, according to the ſcriptures. We call it de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traction in a matter of importance, when you diſcover any thing that diminishes notably the reputation of your neigbour, though the thing be true, if it be ſecret and unknown.</p>
            <p>That this is a mortal ſin, is prov'd out of S. Paul: who recoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting <note place="margin">1. <hi>Cor.</hi> 15</note> the ſins which hinder our entrance into heaven, and the ſin<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ners that shal not poſſeſs the kingdom of God names Detractors
<pb n="235" facs="tcp:108789:122"/> And in another place making a liſt of ſins to which Pagans were addicted, and which Chriſtians muſt avoyd, he adds no Epi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thite to other ſins, he names them all ſimply: but ſpeaking of detractors, ſays, <hi>detractores Deo odibiles,</hi> detractors are odious to <note place="margin">
                  <hi>Rom.</hi> 1. 30.</note> God, hatefull and abominable to him; 'tis then a mortal ſin, ſince it makes us odious to God, and shuts againſt us the ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tes of heaven.</p>
            <p>The reaſon of it is evident; Theft in a matter of importance is it not a mortall ſin? who doubts of it? detraction is theft more notable, unjuſt, and dammagable; <hi>For a good reputation is</hi> 
               <note place="margin">
                  <hi>Prov.</hi> 21. 1.</note> 
               <hi>more precious than great riches,</hi> ſays the wiſeman; he then that robs a man of his good name, does him a greater injury, than he that takes away his money: And in effect, what man of honor would not rather chooſe that one should cut his purs, or burn his houſe, than deprive him of his honor? Divines then conclude by <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap> good conſequence, that detraction is a greater ſin than Robery, becaus it takes away a thing more precious.</p>
            <p>Some may here propoſe a queſtion; There is for example a man addicted to ſwearing, blaſphemy, or detraction; he does ſo ſometimes inconſiderately, lightly, and without reflection: does he ſin mortally as often as that happens to him? Divinity an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwers with a diſtinction, either he takes paines to correct himſelf or not? If he takes paines: if he does ſome penance when he falls into it, then 'tis not a mortal ſin: becaus it is not wholy voluntary; but if he be careleſs, if he endeavours not to correct his bad cuſtome, and to ſtand upon his guard: every time he<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwears falsly, or detracts in a thing of importance, though light<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, and inconſiderately, he ſins mortally: for though ſuch words are not entirely voluntary, when he pronounces them, they are yet voluntary in their cauſe.</p>
            <p n="6">6. If the Detractor kills himſelf, think not others ſafe: for the ſecond wound he makes, is in him that heares: and if there be twenty in the company, perhaps he kills them all. Which S. Thomas pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ves <note place="margin">22. <hi>q.</hi> 75. <hi>ar.</hi> 4: <hi>Rom.</hi> 1 32. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 49. 18.</note> by this of S. Paul: <hi>That not only they who do ill, but alſo they who conſent to it, are worthy of death.</hi> And that the Prophet repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hends sharply not only them that rob with the theef, but thoſe alſo that acompany him. And in that S. Bernard doubts whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
<pb n="236" facs="tcp:108789:123"/> of the two merits more damnation, the dretractor, or he that hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>res him; <note place="margin">

            </p>
            <p>If your neighbors houſe were ſet on fire: would you not be oblig'd, at leaſt by charity, to help him, and to quench it, if you can? He ſuffers a greater loſs in his reputation: your obligation is then greater to defend him from this hurt<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> if then you are in company where one detracts: you are oblig'd to reprehend and correct the detractor, if you have authority over him: and if he detracts by a ly, to shew that what he ſays is fals: if what he ſays is true, to excuſe the abſent diſcreetly: to change the diſcours: to leave the company: but if you cannot do theſe things: to shew unwillingneſs to hear, and a diſpleaſed countenance; for when he ſees rhat you are not pleaſed with his tattle, he will be asham'd, and will learn to hold his peace. <hi>The north wind diſſipates raine, and a ſad look the tongue that detracts.</hi> But if you are glad of the detra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction: if you ſay a word that contributs to it: if you shew by <note place="margin">
                  <hi>Prov,</hi> 25. 23.</note> ſignes that it pleaſes you: if you are cauſe that he proceeds in the diſcours: if you make a shew to know it, to the end he detract more boldly, and without ſcruple, you are as criminal as he, and your ſoul is kill'd. Behold two deaths already cauſed by detraction.</p>
            <p n="7">7 The third is of the poor abſent perſon, whome it kills by a triple murther. We have three ſorts of lives: the natural life: the ſpiritual: and the civil<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> The natural life is the union of the ſoul with the body; The ſpiritual is the union of grace with the ſoul: And the civil is the union of a man with his neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bors, and a good repute amongſt them. Now the detractor ſometimes takes away the firſt life: often the ſecond: and very frequently the third. The firſt ſometimes: either by creating mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal enemies againſt the poor abſent perſon: or by repreſenting him as dishoneſt and unfaithfull, whereby he loſes thoſe employ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, without which he cannot nourish himſelf, nor his. The ſecond often: for ſoon or late the detracted perſon heares of the Detractor, he conceives a hatred of him, and reſolves upon reveng; ah! he ſometimes dyes in this diſpoſition, and with the Devills is dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>n'd for ever. The third frequently: for generally ſpeaking detra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction takes effect, and deprives the detracted of the good opinion
<pb n="237" facs="tcp:108789:123"/> others have of him, which is the cement of the commerce that is between them; ſo the detractor takes away his civil life, and obliges himſelf to reſtitutions, and reparations both of the honor and good name, and of all the expences, dammages, and inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rects cauſed by his detraction, which will be very hardly made.</p>
            <p n="8">8 To avoyd a vice ſo pernicious both to you and others, fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low the counſell of the holy Ghoſt: <hi>Weigh your words in a juſt</hi>

Remember when you are in paſſion and quarelling with your neighbor, <hi>That you utter not the</hi>

                  <hi>Prov.</hi> 25. 8.</note> 
               <hi>things which your eyes have ſeen, lest afterward you cannot amend it, when you have dishonoured him,</hi> ſays the ſacred text. And in effect a detractive word is ſoon let forth, but not ſo ſoon recalled; words have not handells to be pulled back again when they have eſchaped: but they have wings which makes them fly away irre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vocably; if you would repair the honor of your neighbor, whi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther will you go to ſeek all thoſe to whom you have ſpoken, and all thoſe who have ſpoken of it after you? and if you find them, how will you raze out of their minds the bad opinion of their neighbor which you have imprinted in them? And yet 'tis a thing abſolutely neceſſary: unleſs you go to the perſon whom you detracted, and pray him to pardon you, and to free you from the obligation of reſtoring; But if he does not: 'tis a verity avowed by all Doctors, that you ſtand oblig'd to repair his honor: in defect whereof the Pope himſelf cannot abſolve you. Calum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niate not, nor detract then any perſon, but have charity which as the Apoſtle ſays, <hi>Covers a multitude of ſins:</hi> ſo you will enjoy quiet in your ſelf, and peace with others: you will obtain the grace and favour of God in this world, and glory in the other, Amen.</p>

               </gap>queathed them to the faithfull, as the magaſins of his merits, chanells of his graces, and authentick proofs of his Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinity — Yes of his Divinity.</p>
            <p n="2">2. For in the inſtitution and adminiſtration of Sacraments IESUS shews that he is God, ſince He exerciſes and makes appear di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine
<pb n="239" facs="tcp:108789:124"/> perfections, His Power, Wiſdom, Goodneſs, Mercy, Iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice, and Providence.</p>
            <p n="3">3. His Power: They ſay uſually in Philoſophy, that no creature howe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver noble and eminent it may be can ſerve the Creator as an inſtrument, to draw out of nothing another creature: that a Seraphin cannot create, no not inſtrumentally, a drop of water, or one only grain of ſand: Let them change now their tone, and praiſe the power of IESVS CHRIST, who makes uſe of common creatures to produce ſo excellent: of material, to to produce Spiritual: of dead and inanimate creatures, to create a divine life: who makes uſe elements which are in the loweſt order of nature, to produce that which is moſt high and more excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent than all that is in nature: who makes uſe of a little wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter to produce grace, which is a participation of the life of God himſelf.</p>
            <p n="4">4. He shews in this his Wiſdom, diſpoſing of all things ſweetly. leading his creatures to their laſt End by means convenient, and fitted to their nature. If you had not bodys: if you were as An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gells <note place="margin">

               </note> ſeparated from all corporeall matter, God would give you his gifts purely, ſpiritually, and inviſibly; but becaus your ſouls are cloathed with terreſtrial and materiall bodys, God gives you his graces in material elements. and in ſenſible ſignes.</p>
            <p n="5">5. He exerciſes his Goodneſs; for by the malediction thun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred againſt the firſt man and his poſterity, corporeal creatures are <note place="margin">
                  <hi>Wiſdom.</hi> 4.</note> becom to us temptations, ſtumblingblocks, and ſnares: But by the Benediction of IESUS, they are the matter of Sacraments, conduits of his graces, organs of our ſanctification, and inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of our ſalvation.</p>
            <p n="6">6. And whereas He is both mercifull and juſt, in shewing us mercy, he exerciſes his juſtice; for man being by ſin unjuſtly elevated againſt God, who is infinitely above him; he is juſtly punished and humbled, ſeeing himſelf oblig'd to receive his ſalva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion by corporal creatures, which are ſo much below him.</p>
            <p n="7">7. His Providence in ſine herein does shine: He foreſaw that men are naturally inclin'd to an exterior worship: and He pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided Sacraments and Sacrifice, which conſiſt in exterior actions, leſt they should employ themſelves in ſuperſtitions. He ſees that Vnity

               </gap> ſame Religion, and the ſame Church, He inſtitutes exte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riour actions, common to all Chriſtians, by which they may pay to God their Duties, and receive from him his favours.</p>
            <p n="8">8. But IESUS is not only the Authour and Inſtitutor of Sacraments: He is moreover the Diſpencer of them, who vouchſafes to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer and adminiſter them to you; to confer them I ſay, not only as an univerſall and general caus: but alſo as a ſpecial and par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular.</p>
            <p n="9">9. The Nature and the Eſſence of a Sacrament is to be a vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible and effective ſigne of divine and inviſible grace; And they have very great reſemblance with the Authour of grace, with the ſubject of grace, and with the effect of grace. The Authour of grace is IESUS CHRIST Man God, and the Sacraments repreſent him very naturally; For as IESUS CHRIST, if one may ſpeak ſo, is but a holy and wonderfull Compoſitum of the divine Word and humane nature: ſo a Sacrament is but a compoſitum of the word of the Prieſt, and of the material Element. The ſubject of grace, is the perſon that receives it: he is compoſed of body and ſoul; And the matter of the Sacrament is applyed to his body: and the form which conſiſts in words, teaches, excites, and animates the faith and the devotion of his ſoul. The effects of grace are different and very well repreſented by the exteriour ſignes or Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments; The effect of Baptiſmal grace is to cleanſe the ſoul from original ſin, and to temper the ardours of concupiſcence; and what is more proper to repreſent theſe effects than water? The effect of Euchariſtical grace is to feed, nourish, and cherish our ſouls; and what is more proper to ſignify this nourishment, than the ſpecies of bread? we may ſay the ſame of the other Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments as we shal ſee God ayding, when we treat of each one In particular: let us content our ſelves at preſent to ſee, that the Sacraments are practical and effective ſignes of the grace they ſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nify, of which only it now remains to ſpeak.</p>
            <p n="10">10. This word Grace in the Scripture, and in the language of the Faithfull, is taken in divers ſenſes. Firſt, it is taken ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times for all favours that God does us, alſo in the order of
<pb n="241" facs="tcp:108789:125"/> nature; other times for free gifts of God, term'd graces gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tis given: becaus they are not given for the deſerts, not for the benefit of the Receiver: but for the good of the Church, as the gifts of prophecie, preaching, and working miracles.</p>
            <p n="11">11. 'Tis not in any of theſe ſenſes that 'tis taken treating of the Sacraments. 'Tis taken for habitual and ſanctifying grace: which is a moſt excellent quality, that Sanctifys us, and ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders us holy and juſt before God: that makes us children of the eternal Father, Brothers, and Coheires with IESUS CHRIST, living Temples of the holy Ghoſt, Kings of heaven, and <hi>Parta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kers of the Divine nature</hi> ſays S.

If there were a Confeſſor ſo rich and liberal, that he would give five or ſix Guinnies to all that should com and confeſs to him, and as often as they should com, who would not go? would he not be oppreſt with people? We are not Chriſtians if we believe not firmly, that as often as we confeſs, or receive other ſacrament as we ought, we acquire a greater treaſure, than if one should give us a thouſand guinnys; yes, in the ballance of Gods judgment, and in the eſteem of wiſemen, one only degree of grace is more precious, and more worth than all the riches of the Indies, becaus grace is of a ſuperior order to all the goods of nature.</p>
            <p n="14">14. But by the ſacraments you receive not only one degree of grace, but many. In Iſaiah it is ſayd, <hi>You shal draw waters in joy out of the Saviours fountaines:</hi> 'Tis not ſayd, you shal receive they shal be given you: <hi>But you shal draw:</hi> tis not ſayd, <hi>out of ciſterns:</hi> But out of fountaines; if it were ſayd, you shal receive grace you might think that you should receive but as much as one would give you: But ſince tis ſayd, that you may draw, and alſo out of fountaines, which cannot be drain'd, you may take as much of it as you will. The meaſure of the greater or leſser quantity of water that you draw out of a fountaine, is not in the foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine it ſelf: but in the greatneſs or littleneſs of the veſſell where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in you draw it, ſo the meaſure of the greater or leſſer grace you receive in ſacraments, is not in the ſacraments themſelves: but in
<pb n="242" facs="tcp:108789:126"/> the greater or leſſer diſpoſition which you bring; it you com to them with much of faith, attention, contrition, humility, devotion, fervour, and love of God, you will receive in them much grace: if you go to them with little diſpoſition, you will receive but little; and conſequently 'tis more profitable to confeſs and to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municate one only time with-great devotion, than 5. or 6 times with little diſpoſition.</p>
            <p n="14">14. Moreover the ſacraments give not only habitual and ſancti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fying grace: but alſo actual and auxiliary graces, which ayd us to obtain the end for which each Sacrament was inſtituted. I ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plicate my ſelf; when you receive holy Orders in a good ſtate, and with the diſpoſition that you ought, in the ſanctifying grace which you receive, is included a promiſe which God makes you to give you actual graces, to perform well the divine office, to inſtruct the people, to adminiſter the Sacraments, and to do other eccleſiaſtical functions to which you are apply'd and conſecrated by holy Orders. If you marry in a good ſtate, and as a chriſtian, in the ſanctifying grace which you receive, is containd a promiſe that God makes you, to give you in occaſions, actual and auxi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liary graces, to live peaceably with your huſband, to breed up well your children, to reſiſt temptations againſt conjugal chaſtity, and to practiſe other vertues to which marriage obliges you. By which you ſee the great prejudice you do your ſelves, when either you neglect or receive unworthily the Sacraments: you deprive your ſelves of innumerable graces, which God would oblige himſelf to give you in the reſt of your life, as the appurtenances and atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dants of the grace, which you should have receiv'd.</p>
            <p n="16">16. This will render you extreamly culpable in the judgment of God, and you will dye with great regret, ſeeing you had ſo ſouveraigne remedies and helps, and that you neglected ſo much to profit by them. know that the Sacraments are talents, of ineſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mable value: but which are given us with an obligatio<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> to gain by them. In S. Matthew IESUS compares himſelf to a Lord who gave Talents to his ſervants: and finding that he who had recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>v'd <note place="margin">
                  <hi>Mat.</hi> 25.</note> but one had not gaind with it ſayd, caſt the unprofitable ſervant out into exteriout darkneſs: there shal be weeping and gnashing of teeth. What then would He have don to him, if he had loſt his ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent?
<pb n="243" facs="tcp:108789:126"/> what would He have don to him, if he had receiv'd and loſt many? and what will IESUS ſay to us? what will he do to us, if we shal have abuſed, or not uſed and profited in vertue by the talents of the ſacraments He hath given us? what weeping? what regrets? what gnashing of teeth? and what rage againſt our ſelves for having loſt ſo good, ſo eaſy, and ſo frequent occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions to make good our ſalvation, to advance in vertue, to load our ſelves with merits, and to enrich our ſelves for eternity? But vertuous people will reioyce, will admire their own happineſs, and will acknowledg their wiſdom in receiving them often, becaus they will ſee that theſe Sacraments were moſt rich talents, and were gages, and infallible promiſes of the ineſtimable, incomprehenſible, and infinite glory which they shal poſſeſs for ever. Amen.</p>

To know evidently the neceſſity of it, we muſt acknowledg three veri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, founded upon the principles of Chriſtian Religion, received by all Doctors, and drawn from expreſs paſſages of holy ſcripture.</p>
            <p n="1">1. The firſt is, that all Children which are conceiv'd by the ordinary way, all except the Virgin, are ſported with original ſin, are enemies of God, objects of his juſt wrath, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>laves of the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vill, Children of perdition, and victimes of eternal death; I ſay, <hi>conceiv'd by the ordinary way,</hi> to make you underſtand, that the
<pb n="244" facs="tcp:108789:127"/> Son of God being not conceiv'd by this way, but by the opera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the holy Ghoſt, his Conception was not only exempt from all impurity: but hath been the ſource and origin of all puri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of our ſouls and bodys. I have moreover added the Virgin excepted: becaus according to the maxim of S<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> A<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ſtin, when we ſpeak of ſin, we ſpeak not of the Virgin, she having been pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vented with all the graces, and advantaged with all the priviledges that an Omnipotent and loving Son could bountifully beſtow on her whom He choſe to be his Mother. Theſe two then excepted; Tis an Article of faith, that all Children, though their Parents be faithfull and in the ſtate of grace, are ſoiled with ſin, and are fruits of malediction, and damnation: They are ſoiled with ſin, <hi>For in Adam all have ſinned,</hi> ſays S. Paul; and <hi>nothing that is ſoiled shal</hi>

               <hi>enter into heaven,</hi> ſays S. Iohn. They are the objects of Gods an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger: <hi>we were by nature the children of wrath,</hi> ſays S. Paul<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and the anger of God is not a paſſion, but a punishment; the wrath of God upon this ſtilborne infant is never appeaſed: <hi>For he that hath not faith, the wrath of God remaines upon him,</hi> ſays IESUS CHRIST in S, Iohn: but this infant hath neither actual, nor habitual faith: not actual, for he is uncapable of it: not habitual, for he could <note place="margin">3. 36.</note> not receive it but by the Sacrament, and he is dead without it: <hi>the wrath of God remaines upon him.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="2">2. After all this, how do ſome flatter themſelves in their ſins and ſay, that God made us not to caſt us away: that his mercy permits him not to be ſo rigorous as they ſay: that he will ſpare us though we die in the ſtate of ſin; made He theſe poor infants to caſt them away? and nevertheleſs He permits them to be loſt; the mercy of God is greater than you can poſſibly imagin, and not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding, this great mercy, this infinite mercy hinders him not to exerciſe ſuch a ſeverity upon theſe little creatures; And if He be ſo ſevere to them for one only ſin, which they incurre by the misfortune of their condition: what will He be to you for ſo great a number of ſins, which you commit, not by ignorance, conſtraint, ſurpriſe, but ſo freely, and voluntarily?</p>
            <p n="3">3. 'Tis a ſecond Verity that original ſin was an evill ſo deſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perate and incurable, that there was not any pure Creature poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible, that could remedy this evill: that nothing leſs was neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary
<pb n="245" facs="tcp:108789:127"/> than the humiliation, blood. and death of a God, for a medecine to tis mortal maladie. 'Tis eaſy to prove it by the malice of ſin, which offends an infinite Majeſty: but 'tis not neceſſary: ſince it is a common doctrine, that 'tis not but to extreme maladies that one applyes extreme remedies. ſin muſt be a very dangerous and extreme evill, ſince a remedy ſo power<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full, ſtrange, extraordinary, and extreme was neceſſary for it. Ha! you know not ô ſinner! what is a mortal ſin; for if you knew it, you would rather die a thouſand times than com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit it: you would rather eate your tongue, than pronounce one only blaſphemy or fals teſtimony: you would rather burn your hand than reach it out to a dishoneſt, or unjuſt action.</p>
            <p n="4">4. This precious and ineſtimable treaſure of the merits and paſſion of IESUS, is a moſt powerfull remedy for original ſin, but ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vertheleſs unprofitable and uneffectuall, if it be not apply'd to us. Suppoſe that you have here the beſt medecine in the world: if the infirme perſon take in not, it ſerves for nothing; ſo though the precious blood of IESUS, and the infinite merits of his paſſion be more than moſt ſufficient to deliver us from ſin: if they be not appropriated and appli'd to us by the Sacrament, they are uneffectuall and unprofitable. So we ſee the Scripture at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tributes <note place="margin">1. <hi>Ep.</hi> 1. 7. <hi>Ephes.</hi> 5. 26. 1. <hi>Pet.</hi> 1. 19. <hi>Tit.</hi> 3. 5. <hi>Iohn.</hi> 3. 3. 6. <hi>S.

               </note> to the water of Baptiſme the ſame effects, it attributes to the blood of IESUS CHRIST: becaus water aplyes the vertue of it. <hi>The blood of IESVS CHRIST cleanſes us,</hi> ſays S. Iohn. <hi>IESVS CHRIST cleanſeth his Church by the Baptiſme of wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor,</hi> ſays, S. Paul. S. Peter, <hi>We are ſaved by the blood of the immaculate Lamb.</hi> S. Paul, <hi>God hath ſaved us by the Baptiſme of regeneration.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>In S. Iohn IESUS repeats twice with great inſtance, that none may pretend ignorance: <hi>Amen Amen I ſay to thee, if any one be not regenerated of water and the holy Ghoſt, he shal not enter into the kingdom of heaven.</hi> Hence the primitive Chriſtians, if an infant was in danger, <hi>ran haſtily to the Church, and in great fear leſt the infant should dye without the ſacrament.</hi> Hence S. Cyprian ſays, <hi>with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out Baptiſme infants are loſt.</hi> Hence S. Auſtin gives us this cave<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>at, <hi>ſay not, teach not if you will be a Catholick, that infants depar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting before Baptiſme can com to remiſſion of their original ſins.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Now I make your ſelves Iudges, whom we ought to belive either
<pb n="246" facs="tcp:108789:128"/> a Quaker or ſome other Reformer, who ſay that tis not neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary to baptiſe an infant: or the primitive Chriſtians, the holy Fathers, nay or IESUS CHRIST himſelf, who ſays ſo clearly, and with ſuch aſſeveration that it is neceſſary for him.</p>
            <p n="7">7. From theſe Catholick Verities, all married women ought to learn, to have great care, that their daughters, and ſervants alſo, know well all that is neceſſary for the eſſence of this ſacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment: and that they know well what I am about to ſay of it. In caſe of neceſſity, each one may baptize an infant, alſo the Father or Mother in defect of another: and if you will that the child be ſaved: ſee what you muſt do; You muſt take water, not ſpittle, aquavitae, roſewater, or any other made by art, but natural water, of fountaine, ſea, river, pit, pond, or well: you muſt wet or waſh the body of the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fant with it: the head if you can poſſibly: and if you can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not wash the head, you muſt put water upon the breſt, arme, foot, or upon ſome other naked part. and the same perſone that puts water, muſt in putting it ſay diſtinctly, (with intention to purge him from original ſin, and to make him a member of the Church, or at leaſt, to do what the Church does) theſe words; Infant, <hi>I Baptiſe thee in the Name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the holy Ghoſt.</hi> But the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fant that should be perhaps baptized upon any other part than the head: when the head appears, you muſt baptiſe him again under condition, ſaying, <hi>Infant. if thou art not baptized, I baptiſe thee in the Name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the holy Ghoſt.</hi> Becaus Baptiſme that is given upon any other part, <note place="margin">3. <hi>Part q.</hi> 66. <hi>ar.</hi> 7.</note> is not certen, ſays S. Thomas.</p>
            <p>And when you are not certen that the child is dead, you ought to baptiſe him under condition, and ſay, <hi>If tbou art living, I baptize thee in the Name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the holy Ghoſt.</hi> For as S<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Auſtin ſpeaking of a Catechumen that fell into an Apoplexie having not demanded Baptiſme ſays that he ought to be baptized; becaus 'tis better to put your ſelf in danger of baptizing one unwilling, than to be wanting to one willing; So when you doubt if a child be living, 'tis better to put your ſelf in danger of baptizing a dead child, than not to baptize
<pb n="247" facs="tcp:108789:128"/> one living; And becaus the life of theſe little creatures is ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times ſo feeble and imperceptible, that we thinke them wholy dead, though a longtime after they give ſignes of life. I ſay 'tis good thar every woman should know all this: for it happens ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times that a woman falls into labour ſuddenly and unexpectedly, and that the infant cannot be brought perfectly into the world ali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ve: or it is ſo weake that likely it will die before an ordinary Miniſter of this Sacrament can be had; if thoſe about her know not how to baptize, the infant may be for want of this help depriv'd of Salvation; and if this should happen but once in the whole world in a hundred years: for to avoyd it, every one should learn with great care how to apply this Sacrament, ſo important is the ſalvation of a ſoul.</p>
            <p n="8">8. And this again is of ſo great importance, that very learned and pious Bishops, and other Divines have counſelled all Curates to baptiſe under condition, all infants that had been baptized by women; for though ſome know well the matter and the form of Baptiſme, they are nevertheleſs ſo ſurprized, and in ſuch a hurrie in theſe conjunctures, that often they know not what they do; and this is not only the judgment of thoſe Bishops, but <note place="margin">

               </note> the expreſs opinion of S. Thomas.</p>
            <p n="9">9. In fine married women ought to learn that they are moſt culpable in the ſight of God, if their infant die before Baptiſme becaus they defer it too long expecting Goſſips, or for other hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane reaſons or conſiderations: or becaus they hurt themſelves and lie down before their time; if this happen with out your fault<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> you may comfort your ſelves in your innocencie and adore the Providence of God; but if you have hurt your ſelves by your fault leaping, danſing, putting your ſelves into great paſſion, or by carrying too heavy burdens; 'tis an evill which hath no excuſe, and which deſerves to be deplor'd all the reſt of your life.</p>
            <p n="10">10. But if it be ſo great a misfortune to thoſe poor infant<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> not to receive the grace of Baptiſme though without their fault: It is no ſmal miſery to loſe it after we have receiv'd it, and to loſe it by our fault for a paſſion, or a trifle; eſpecially ſince it is ſo hard to returne again by penance, to the ſame newneſs in CHRIST, and to obtain ſo full and entire remiſſion of all ſins as
<pb n="248" facs="tcp:108789:129"/> in Baptiſme we receiv'd. The juſtice of God exacts to this effect a ſecond Baptiſme, a Baptiſme not of elementary water, but of teares, a laborious<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> painfull, and ſorrowfull Baptiſme, ſay the holy Fathers, and the Council of Trent. For ſins commited after Baptiſme are far greater, more enormous, and unworthy of par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don, <note place="margin">

            <p>We are not ſtrangers, but domeſticks of God, his children, and beloved. We have the honor to be received to his table, to eate of his bread, and to be nourished with his flesh; if then we offend him after ſo many favours, he is very ſenſible of the offence, it is a monſtrous ingratitude: as when one of your own betrays you, you are wont to ſay: if it were another, it would not trouble me: but ſuch an one, who pertains to me ſo neer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, whom I have ſo much oblig'd, ha! this does pierce my heart! ſo IESUS ſays, <hi>ſi inimicus meus maledixiſſet mihi, ſustinuiſſem utique:</hi> if a Turk, a Iew, a Pagan who is my enemy offend me, the injury is not ſo ſenſible; But you, a Chriſtian: who have contracted amitle with me, who have ſet at my table. how have you the malice to commit ſin, which diſobliges me extreamly? we have receiv'd the grace of God by Baptiſme, the gifts of the holy Ghoſt, the ſupernatural habits, helps to overcom temptations: if we ſin notwithſtanding theſe favours, we have much leſs ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſe.</p>
            <p>Do not ſo if you be wiſe! If you have yet baptiſmal grace: If you are cloathed with this fine garment, which S.

What honor! what dignity! and what admirable prerogatives! They that are members of IESUS CHRIST and the children of God, ought they not to lead a life conformable to this dignity? thy that receiv'd the Spirit of God in Baptiſme, should they not act and ſpeak according to this divine Spirit?

            <p n="1">1. Before I proceed to the proofs of theſe important Points, I explicate my ſelf; By the ſin of the firſt man, and by our own crimes we deſerve to die effectually the death of soul and body, and to be b<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

            <p>Can we be good Chriſtians and not appertain to IESUS? Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vertheleſs the Apoſtle of JESUS ſays, that we appertain not to him, if we crucify not our flesh. He ſays not, they that appertain to him in the quality of Religious, or Prieſts: But all they that ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pertain to IESUS CHRIST, Crucify their flesh. And S.

            <p n="3">3. It imports much to note what is the Grace of each Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and what charg it puts upon us; for each ſacrament con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferrs a ſpecial grace, and to this grace ſome charg is annexed, to which we oblige our ſelves. Tis a Talent given us with a ſtrict obligation to employ it. The grace of Confirmation, is a ſpirit
<pb n="251" facs="tcp:108789:130"/> of Fortitude, which obliges us to make profeſſion of the Faith in Preſence of Tyrants, alſo with perill of our lives. The grace of Confeſſion is a ſpirit of Penance, which obliges us to ſatisfacto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry workes, to faſts, alms, prayers, and other actions which S. Iohn Baptiſt terms, <hi>Fruits worthy</hi> of <hi>penance.</hi> the grace of Bapti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>me is a ſpirit of the Croſs and death, which obliges us to die to ſin, to the world, and to our ſelves; if then we have any volun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tary affection to the Pomps of the world, to the delights of the flesh, to the ſatisfaction of unruly paſſions: if we are wed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded to our own conduct, to our proper judgment, and not to that of our Superiours, we are wanting to the grace of this Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament; for we are baptized to be made Chriſtians, that is Diſciples of Chriſt: and He ſays to us expreſly, <hi>He that renounces</hi>

But this death is like to that of the Phenix, which dies not, but to acquire a new life; 'Tis as that of IESUS, who was ſpoyled of a mortal and fading life, to reſume a glorious and immortal.

               <hi>rather obey God than men.</hi> You ſee then, that this Sacrament ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kes ſouldiers of IESUS CHRIST, and gives us force to fight for him; wherefore it imprints a Character: and it belongs to <hi>a</hi> Bishop only to conferr it: He adminiſters it with the thumb: with Unction of ſacred Chriſme compoſed of oyle and balme: he makes the ſigne of the Croſs upon the forehead, and gives a lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle ſtroke upon the cheek.</p>
            <p n="4">4. It imprints a character in our ſoul; for characters are im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>printed in us by ſome Sacraments, to mark and diſtinguish us from other men, and to deſigne us paticularly to the ſervice of God; by Baptiſme we are made his ſubjects: by holy Order, Officers and Miniſters of his Church: and by Confirmation, we are made his Soldiers.</p>
            <p n="5">5. I know well that by Baptiſme we are alſo made ſpiritual ſol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers: and for this we uſe unction in it; But this is only to fight in our own quarrell, againſt the Devill and other particular Enemies; As the Burgeſſes of a Town, though they are not by pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion ſoldiers, faile not to have arms and to fight in need, in defence of their perſones, or their countrey.</p>
            <p n="6">6. But by Confirmation we are made ſoldiers to fight, not in our particular quarrells, but in thoſe of IESUS-CHRIST: ſoldiers by office and profeſſion: to the end we fight for him againſt Tyrants, againſt the World, and againſt the Enemies of his Religion.</p>
            <p n="7">7. And hence it proceeds that every one may Baptize in neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſity: and that a Bishop only may Confirm; for to make a ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject of a king we need not but to cauſe a child to be born in his kingdom; But to raiſe and enrole ſoldiers, belongs not but to Captaines; ſo to make us Vaſſalls of IESUS: on needs not but to make us to be borne in the Church his kingdom, which is don by Baptiſme; But to make us his ſoldiers by Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmation, one muſt be a Bishop or Prelate of the Church.</p>
            <p n="8">8. In making us ſoldiers He gives us arms and force by the grace of this Sacrament; And hence it is that the Bishop gives it with his thumb, the ſtrongeſt of all the fingers. He gives it by unction: to ſignify the interiour Vnction and force, by which we are fitted to appear in the field; Balm is thereto added, becaus we muſt fight publickly for IESUS: and if we
<pb n="257" facs="tcp:108789:133"/> do well, we are a good odour to the ſon of God, and to his Church, <hi>Chriſti bonus odor ſumus in omni loco.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="9">9. This unction is made in the form of a Croſs: becaus the Croſs is the ſtandard and the enſigne of the warfare in which we enrole our ſelves.</p>
            <p n="10">10. This Croſs is made in the forehead, the ſeat of bashful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs to teach us, that thenceforth we muſt not be asham'd of the Croſs of IESUS: that we ought to embrace with a holy boldneſs, the reproaches, confuſions, humiliations, and the mortifications, which occurre in the practiſe of Chriſtian ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tues; and to make us know that we muſt be ready to receive and endure affronts and ignominies, for the defence of Iesus, He gives us a little blow.</p>
            <p n="11">11, It was not in vain, nor without much reaſon, that IESUS inſtituted a particular Sacrament, ſo great a Sacrament, a Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment which imprints a character, which a Bishop only can con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferr, which gives ſuch plenitude of the holy Ghoſt to arme and fortify us, not only againſt Tyrants, but alſo againſt the Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecutors of chriſtian piety and devotion. For chriſtian Religion which is almoſt freed from the perſecution of pagans, is at pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent tyranized by the babble, raillery, and deriſion of wordly ſouls. Wherefore S. Bernard ſayd, the Church may truly ſay, <hi>In pace amaritudo mea amariſſima: my affliction is moſt bitter in the time of</hi> 
               <note place="margin">

               <hi>peace: It was bitter in the death that Tyrants made the Martyrs to endure: more hitter in the infidelity of Hereticks: But 'tis moſt bitter in the ill life of Chriſtians,</hi> who mock and laugh at the piety of devout Souls; For this is much more hurtfull than that of Tyrants. In the perſecution of Tyrants Chriſtians dared not to pray, nor to exerciſe devotion in publick, they ſought caves, grotes, and private houſes: but they ſerved God freely at leaſt in theſe places; the perſecution of worldlings is the caus that many dare not ſerve God as they ought in particular houſes, for fear to be called devotes: they dare not frequent the Sacraments, or be aſſiduous at divine ſervice, becaus they call them hypocrites: they dare not be conſcientious and reſtrain'd from unhandſom words and inſolent actions, becaus they call them ſcrupulous: a ſin deteſtable and wholy unnatural, to perſecute chriſtianity in chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chriſtianity
<pb n="258" facs="tcp:108789:134"/> it ſelf: to have ſworn fidelity to IESUS in the Sacrament of Baptiſme, and laugh at thoſe who are faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full to him: not to ſerve God themſelves: and to deride thoſe that ſerve him: a ſin, not of frailty, nor of ignorance, but of malice and contempt: which drawes from them the grace of God, indurates and diſpoſes them to impenitence and reprobation. The children of Hely who averted the people from devotion, <note place="margin">1. <hi>Kings.</hi> 3. 14.</note> committed an abominable crime in the ſight of God, which could not be expiated by victimes, ſays the holy Scripture.</p>
            <p n="12">12. This temptation is ſo dangerous, alſo to devout ſouls, that they who ſtand invincible againſt other aſſaults, permit themſel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ves to be overcom by this: becaus good natures are facile, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaiſant, and condeſcending: they have ſo much fear and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſion to do or omit any thing that may diſpleas another, or which they apprehend may leſſen their own honor or reputation, that one only thought, <hi>What will they think? what will they say?</hi> will render al predications, remonſtrances, and exhortations uneffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctual.</p>
            <p>Say for example to this Gentleman or Duelliſt, you live upon the brink of hell: you may ſay every morning when you riſe, perhaps in the evening I shall go to bed in hell; there needs no more than that a friend do pray you to ſerve him as a Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond, to be kill'd in this action and behold you are moſt me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerable for an eternity.

            <p>Say to this Lady, the extravagance of your cloathes does pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judice much your ſalvation; it conſumes the beſt part of your time: it fills your ſoul with pride and vanity, it wedds your heart to trifles: it renders you unable to pay debts: to give neceſſary aſſiſtance to the Poor: you would do well to cloath your ſelf more ſimply and modeſtly. I would do it willingly, she will aſſure you: <hi>But what will they ſay?</hi>

            <p n="13">13. But what are they you fear ſo much? Atheiſts, impious,
<pb n="259" facs="tcp:108789:134"/> or at beſt, light, looſe, and libertine Chriſtians; good and vertuous ſoules, ſolid and underſtanding perſons will eſteem and honour you. If a Criple should laugh at you, becaus you go ſtraight: would you do well, to be asham'd of it, and to counterfeit your ſelf a criple?

            <p n="14">14. Whatſoever you do: you will be the But of evill tongues; your intentions will be judged: your actions cenſured. If you be meanly cloathed, they eſteem you a hypocrice; if well cloathed according to your condition, proud; If thrifty, avari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious; if liberal, prodigal; if you pardon injuries, a coward? if you defend your right, revengfull; if you faſt, a diſſembler<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> If you nourish your ſelf, a glutton; if peaceable, negligent; If vigilant in your duty, turbulent; If quick at maſs, indevout; if long, ſcrupulous; if you preach mildly: you lull people a ſleep; if vigorouſly, you are paſſionate; if you reprehend vices, you are too violent; if you reprehend them not, a flatterer; S.

               <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg>ESUS CHRIST being both God and man, hath always two intentions in his enterprizes: He regards the glory of God, and the ſalvation of men; wherefore He willed that the Euchariſt should be a Sacrifice, and a Sacrament, a Victime and a food; In the quality of a Sacrifice and a Hoſt, it is referr'd to the glory of God; in the quality of a Sacrament and food, it is referr'd to the ſalvation of men. I shal treat of it as a Sacrifice in another place; In this, I ſpeak of it as a Sacrament, and demonſtrat that it contains really, truly, and ſubſtantially the precious Body of JESUS CHRIST.</p>
            <p n="1">1. And to convince an underſtanding thar teceives the holy Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, <hi>I</hi> need not other proof than the clear teſtimony of the Son <note place="margin">

Paul does teſtify; <hi>I have learned of our Lord</hi> ſays He, <hi>and not of men that being in the laſt ſupper He ſayd to his Diſciples, take, eate, This is my Body.</hi>

            <p n="2">2. Notwithſtanding the evidence of theſe words, Calvin is ſo
<pb n="261" facs="tcp:108789:135"/> bold as to ſay that what our Saviour held in his hand and gave to his Apoſtles, was not his Body, but bread, a figure or shadow of his Body. I would know, if our Saviour de<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

If all the men in the world should employ a thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand years in ſeeking terms to expreſs themſelves: could they ſpeak more clearly, than ſaying <hi>This is my Body; And the bread which I will give you is my flesh.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="3">3. But ſuppoſe that theſe words are obſcure; to whom ought we to referr our ſelves for the meaning of them? Either to Calvin who came more than fifteen hundred years after CHRIST, or to the judgment of the Faithfull who lived in the times of the four firſt general Councells, during which Calvin himſelf avo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ws, that the Church was in her purity? The Goſpell ſays, that we muſt credit two or three good Witneſſes: behold here ſix authentik ones: three of the Greek, and three of the Latine Church; S. Cyrill of Hieruſalem who had place in the ſecond <note place="margin">4. <hi>Miſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gog: cat.</hi>
               </note> general Council held in the year 381. teaching his people by the Scripture, and according to the ſenſe of the whole Church of his age, ſpeaks thus; Since then our Saviour himſelf declares and ſays of bread <hi>This is my Body,</hi> who shal henceforth dare to doubt of it? And He affirming and ſaying <hi>This is my blood,</hi> who is he that shal doubt of it ſaying 'tis not his blood? Heretofore in Cana of Galli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lee He changed water into wine: is He not worthy to be belie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved changing wine into into blood? Vnder the ſpecies of bread the Body is given, and under the ſpecies of wine the blood is given his Body and his blood is receiv'd into our members. That which ſeems bread, is not bread, though the taſte preceives it ſuch, but the Body of Chriſt; and that which ſeems wine, is not wine, though the taſte repreſents it ſuch, but rhe Blood of Chriſt.</p>
            <p>S. Cyrill of Alexandria who aſſiſted in the third general Councel held at Epheſus in his 13. book upon Leviticus, in the mid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle ſays, Leſt we should have horour of flesh and blood put upon our Altars: God condeſcending to our weakneſs, infuſes into the things we offer, to wit into bread and wine, the vertue of life, converting them into the verity of his own flesh.</p>

            <p>Let vs ioyn to the Golden mouth to the Ambroſian mouth, that is to ſay, S. Ambroſe to S. Chryſoſtom; This bread before the Sacramental words, is bread: but when the conſecration is don, of bread is made the flesh of CHRIST; by what words? of IESUS CHRIST: by the word which made althings; the Heaven was not before the creation, the ſea was not, the earth was not: but He ſpoke, and they were made, He commanded and they were created: ſo I anſwer you, before the Conſecration this was not the Body of Chriſt: but after Conſecration J ſay to you that 'tis the Body of IESUS: IESUS hath ſpoke the words.</p>
            <p>In Africa they Spoke as they did in Italy, becaus they had there the ſame faith, which made S. Cyprian or the Authour of the supper of our Lord to ſay, the bread which our Lord gave to his Diſciples being changed, not in appearance, but in nature, was made flesh by the omnipotency of the Word.</p>
            <p>In fine great S. Auguſtine in a ſermon upon the Title of the 33: Pſalm admiring theſe words <hi>And He was carried in his own hands</hi> ſayd, this cannot be underſtood of David nor of any o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther than of Iesus CHRIST: for who is he that can carry him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf in his hands?

            </p>
            <p>If you will weigh with me the circumſtances of the Inſtitution of this Sacrament, you will have no difficulty to embrace the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ith of theſe holy Doctors: and you will ſee the great injury they do our Lord who ſay, that He gave to his Diſciples, but only bread as the figure and the memory of his Body.</p>

Is it not to Embaſſadors that a King is wont to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cover his deſignes, to open the ſecrets of his heart, to give par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular Inſtructions, that they may negotiate the better his affaires?

            <p>Let us Conſider in the third place, the Circumſtance of Time; He eates firſt the Paſchal Lamb with them; and afterward to mount up to a higher Miſterie, to paſs from the figure to the reality, from the image to the verity. from the promiſe to the accomplishment, and from the shadow to the Body: He gives them his precious Body: If the bread that He gave them were not his Body, but a figure only, it would be in vain that He gave it: it would be an unprofitable and ſuperfluous repetition, not of word, but deed: ſince the Paſchal Lamb was a figure more expreſs, more diſtinct, and more ſignificant of his Body, than a morcel of bread.</p>
            <pb n="264" facs="tcp:108789:137"/>
            <p> In giving it to them He ſayd<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 
               <hi>with deſire I have deſired to eate this Paſche with you before I ſuffer.</hi> This deſire was not only to eate the Paſchal Lamb with his Diſciples, ſince He had eaten it ſo often with them, and that He had had this deſire lo long; <hi>with deſire I have deſired,</hi> ſays He, that is J have long ſince vehemently deſired; and this deſire of IESUS, this great deſire of IESUS, this deſire which the amorous heart of JESUS hath had ſo long, shal it not have had for object but to eate with his Apoſtles a morcel of bread?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>He ſayd before I ſuffer:</hi> and S. Paul, <hi>in which night He was betrayd:</hi> 
               <note place="margin">1. <hi>Cor.</hi> 11. 23.</note> to make vs know, that being neer his death, He made his Will and Teſtament, and He declares it in expreſs words: <hi>This Chalice is the new Teſtament in my blood.</hi> A wiſe man, who loves his children, making his Will, ſpeaks as clearly as he can: if any one makes it in doubtfull and ambiguous words: 'tis becaus he is little intelligent in affairs: or will leave ſuits, not goods to his heires; if my Father had left me a houſe, and you would con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſt with me ſaying, 'tis a paper or painted houſe he means: what Judg would hear you? what impartial Arbiter would not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demn you: would you not injure me, and yet more my father? if he had meant a paper houſe, would he not have declared his intention? IESUS our celeſtial Father makes his Teſtament, He declares his laſt Will, He ſays that He leaves me his precious Body: and you ſay 'tis not his true Body, 'tis a figure of his Body; goe you are a mocker: if it was not but his figure would He not have ſayd ſo as well as you? would He have ſayd <hi>This is my Body,</hi> inſtead of ſaying this is my figure?</p>
            <p>He is upon his departure in his laſt ſupper: He goes to death and afterward to the imperial heaven; when a loving husband is vpon his deathbed, or bids farwell to his dear ſpouſe for a journey ſomewhat long: is it not then that he opens his heart to her, and discovers to her his ſecrets? is it not then that he ſpeaks to her without ambiguitie? that he gives her teſtimonyes of his greateſt affection, and leaves her the more precious preſents? And JESUS being in the vigill of his death: giving his farwell to the Church his Spouſe, and depriving her of his Viſible preſence, shal He have ſpoken obſcurely and equivocally to her? shal He
<pb n="265" facs="tcp:108789:137"/> shal He have deceived her in a matter of ſo great impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance, and for all nuptial preſents, for the gage of his amity, for the teſtimonie of his tender affections, for a ſupplement of his abſence, shal He have left her only a morcell of bread?</p>
            <p>The manner alſo in which He accomplishes this Miſtery ought to be conſidered; if this be but a morcel of bread; Why pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes He it ſo long before; why ſpeaks He of it with ſo much pomp? Why prayſes He the effects and neceſſitie of it ſo much? Why prefers He it before the Manna? <hi>the bread which I will give you is my flesh; he that shal eate of this bread hath everlaſting life; If you eate not my flesh you shal not have life in in you; This is not as the manna your fathers have eaten;</hi> If that which He gives is but a mite of bread: the manna was to be prefer'd before it; It was the figure of the Body of IESUS CHRIST, as well as Calvins bread, and much more expreſs; for it was moulded<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

            <p>After He had promiſed it ſo long time, and ſo ſolemnly, He gives it; but washes firſt the feet of his Diſciples: He makes them a long and ſublime ſermon: He recommends to them puri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie and charitie: He makes to his Father a very long prayer, and if all this tended but to give them a piece of bread, I make you judg.</p>

The Son of God in his Divinity is living bread, enlivening bread, the bread of Angells; The Celeſtial Spirits do not live, are not nourished, ſaciated, and happy but by ſeeing, loving, poſſeſſing, enioying God. men alſo ought to be nourished with the ſame food: but in this mortall life, they are uncapable to enjoy God in his proper form, they cannot ſee him openly, and face to face; what hath the Son of God don, who compares himſelf in Scripture to a loving Mother? He incarnated this bread: this divine Word incorporated himſelf, and took the form of flesh and blood. And becaus men would have had fear and horrour to eate his flesh and drink his blood in the form He was: He concocted this Bread a ſecond time in the breaſt of this Sacrament, by the heat of his heart, by an ardent love He again transform'd this Word, and cloathed himſelf with the ſpecies of bread and wine, which are common and uſuall with us, to be the milk and nourishment of men, who are his little chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren. And as a mother giving her breaſt to an infant expoſeth herſelf to many importunities, incommodities and pinches which he gives her; So our Saviour shut his Eyes to many conſiderations of his glory, and of his intereſt which might have hindred Him from inſtituting this Sacrament; He expoſed himſelf to a thouſand affronts which He receives, and will receive to the end of the world, from Hereticks, bad Catholicks, and vicious Prieſts, that communicate in the ſtate of ſin; and <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>hough He be the Sovereign Purity, the eſſentiall Sanctity who abhorrs ſin infinitely: yet is content to ſuffer all theſe injuries, rather than deprive his well be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loved children of the happineſs of this breaſt.</p>
            <p n="3">3. Jn the ſecond place, this Sacrament is compared to milk in the manner 'tis to be receiv'd; It muſt be taken as children take the breſt with faith, hunger, and familiarity.</p>
            <p n="4">4. An infant takes the breaſt with shut eyes: he examins no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing, but ſucks the breaſt truſting to his mother<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> a Diſſenrer propoſes queſtions as the Capharnaits: how can this man gives us his flesh <note place="margin">
                  <hi>Pſal.</hi> 130.</note> to eate? How can ſo great a body be contained in ſo little a Hoſt? <hi>If I am not humble, and if I exalt my Soul, I shal be like to an infant</hi>
               <pb n="270" facs="tcp:108789:140"/> 
               <hi>that is weaned from the breſt,</hi> ſayd the royal Prophet. This happens to a Diſſenter; he exalts his Soul, thinking that he hath much of knowledg and underſtanding: he examins the power of the Omni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>potent, and will find that to be impoſſible which our Saviour ſayd: and he is weaned from this ſacred breſt. Catholicks as humble, ſimple, docible children, truſt the Church their Mother, who neither can, nor would if she could deceive them; they ſilence ſenſes, and shut the eyes of fallible reaſon, to open only thoſe of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fallible Faith.</p>
            <p n="5">5. They that have a lively faith of that which is contained in this Sacrament, have a great appetite to it, an earneſt deſire of it, and therefore they reape incredible fruits from it. The Virgin ſayd in her canticle, <hi>God fills the hungry with good things,</hi> Such as appro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ach to him with a Spiritual greedineſs and avidity. ſee, ſays S. Chryſoſtome, with what readineſs a little infant takes the teat, with what force he joyns himſelf to the breſt: you would thinke that <note place="margin">
                  <hi>Hom</hi> 60. <hi>ad pop.</hi>
               </note> he would thruſt himſelf into the breſt of his mother: or that he would ſuck out the heart and ſoul of his nource; and if he be one only day without this refection, he is wholy unquiet, troubleſome, and inſupportable. Do the ſame, ſays this holy Doctor: go to the Body of IESUS amorouſly, ardently; and greedily, as if you wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uld lodg your ſelf in the ſacred ſide of JESUS, unite your ſelf to Him, heart to heart, ſoul to ſoul, eſſence to eſſence, and transform your ſelf wholy unto Him: and when by your fault you are depriv'd of this di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine refection, be ſorry and troubled, as having ſuffered a great loſs.</p>
            <p n="6">6. And after you have had the happineſs to receive, make good uſe of it. This Sacrament hath a permanent Being, and remaines as long as the ſpecies in the ſtomack, that IESUS may have leaſure to convers with us, and we with Him. We ought then to keep him company, to court and entertain him by acts of adoration, grati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude, love, oblation of our ſelves, with reſolution to ſerve Him well; we muſt believe He coms to us full of good will for us: that He deſires nothing more than to fill us with goods, to embrace us, and to unite himſelf to us for ever; we muſt caſt our ſelves into his armes, as an infant into his mothers, put into his hand with great confidence our affaires, afflictions, ſalvation, and our family: ô God! I truſt in you: you are infinitely good, you
<pb n="271" facs="tcp:108789:140"/> give your ſelf to me, you will give ſurely that which is much leſs.</p>
            <p n="7">7. The third conformitie of the Euchariſt with milk is in the manner of their operation.</p>
            <p>Firſt this is proper to milk amongſt other nourishments, that it is the whole feaſt and the entire refection of the infant? it Satiſfys hunger and thirſt, and ſerves him for meat and drink; And this is alſo proper to the Euchariſt, that in one only Species of it is contain'd the whole refection of the Soul: you are as well com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municated and ſpiritually fed in taking the Hoſt alone, as in recei<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ving both Hoſt and Chalice.</p>
            <p n="8">8. Here Diſſenters think that they have a great advantage of us declaming againſt our communion in one kind; But I ſee not how they can except againſt it: For whatſoever the proteſtant people do in receiving of this Sacrament, Catholicks do or may do too, and what more ought to be don, the Catholick Church does it, and the Proteſtants do it not. muſt one feed upon Chriſt Cruci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied, by Faith; Catholicks do it; muſt the Euchariſt be taken in remembrance of Him and his Death and Paſſion? they do it; muſt the people drink wine out of a Cup? Catholick people do the like; and over and above this, they communicate the very Body of their Redeemer, animated with his Soul, full of blood, and hypoſtatically united to his Deity; this ought to be don, to the end we may have life in us: and Diſſenters do it not. But ſince they deſiſt not to cry out and ſay, that we deprive our people of the neceſſary means, which Chriſt hath left them for their Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation: I muſt make you ſee, that the holy Scripture, the Fathers and Antiquity do authorize our practiſe.</p>
            <p n="9">9. What pretend you in communicating? Is it not to have eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall life? you will acquire right to it in receiving but the Hoſt; for IESUS CHRIST ſayd in moſt clear words, <hi>He that eates</hi> 
               <note place="margin">

               <hi>of this bread shal live for ever.</hi> And before the murmuration of the Capharnaits, He ſpoke not of drinking his Blood, but of eating his Body only. He ſpoke not then of drinking his Blood, but to anſwer to the groſs thought of the Capharnaits, and to tell them that they were not to eate his flesh ſeparated from his blood dead, cut, and mangled, as S. Auſtin ſays they thought, but
<pb n="272" facs="tcp:108789:141"/> to eate his living Body full of blood. Nor did He command all men to drink of the chalice or cup when He ſayd in S. Matthew, <hi>Drink ye all of this:</hi> For theſe words were not ſpoken to all men: nor to all the Faithfull: But to all the Apoſtles, and to them all only: which is manifeſt out of the text it ſelf; for what S. Matthew ſays was commanded to all, S. Marke relates to have been anſwerably perform'd by all: <hi>they drank all thereof;</hi> the ſecond all is reſtrain'd to all the Apoſtles, to whom only He ſpoke theſe words, as alſo the other before and after, and who were then made Prieſts; what reaſon then is there to extend the former words farther then the Apoſtles? Chriſt himſelf gave moſt <note place="margin">
                  <hi>S. Luke</hi> 24.</note> probably the Euchariſt under one only ſpecies to the Diſciples that went to Emaus: for He vanished, ſays S.

               </note> S. Paulinus, V. Bede and other Doctors do underſtand, and alſo prove to have been the holy Euchariſt. And 'tis evident in S. Ambroſe, in Euſebius, in S.

            <p n="9">9. Milk is given to an infant to nourish and make him grow; and the Euchariſt was inſtituted to make the children of the Church to increaſe and thrive in Chriſtian perfection; and therefore tis inſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tituted under the ſpecies of bread, which nourishes, fortifys, and cauſes groweth. <note place="margin">

            <p n="10">10. Milk hath this property that it communicates often to infants the humours, and the complexion of the Nource; when the Poets deſcribe a cruel man, they are not content to ſay, a rock hath brought him forth: but they add, that Tygars have given him ſuck. And the holy Canons counſell mothers to nourſe their own Children as much as may be, for fear that giving them to vicious perſons, they ſuck with milk<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> the ill humours of the nources; The Son of God is not content to bring us forth in Baptiſme: He himſelf gives the breſt: He nourishes us with his own flesh, that He may com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municate his own inclinations to us. He after communion ſayd to
<pb n="273" facs="tcp:108789:141"/> his Diſciples, <hi>That the world may know I love my Father, riſe let us go,</hi> to ſuffer for his glory; So after communion we muſt examin our ſelves: what ſervice can I render to God? what can I do that may conduce to his honor? what is that in me or mine that diſpleaſes him, and which I may correct? if we uſe ſo this precious milk, it will make us grow in perfection: it will make us like to Him, who nourishes us with his own ſubſtance: it will give us his complexion and reſemblance: and if we reſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Him on earth in the life of grace, we shal reſemble Him in heaven in the life of glory.

            <p>S. Chryſoſtome the Oracle of the greek and eaſtern Church ſayd, Becaus this Sacrifice is offered in many places, are there many Chriſts? No: for as He who is offered every where, is one body, and not many bodys, ſo the Sacrifice is but one. <note place="margin">

But the God of mercies look in his good time upon our Perſecutors favourably: becaus they do it ignorant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and in incredulity: and becaus they are the far greater Sufferers, being deprived of a Sacrifice ſo acceptable and glorious to God, and ſo profitable and neceſſary to men.</p>

            <p>He honors the juſtice of his Father, in that He avows He hath deſerved death, and annihilation for the ſins of men, for whom He made himſelf a Propitiatour.</p>
            <p>He honors his mercy, in that He tranſfer'd upon his innocent ſon the debts of criminal ſervants; and in that He accepts the ſacrifice of his precious Body, and myſtical effuſion of his Blood, inſtead of the true and real death that we deſerve.</p>
            <p>He honors Him as the laſt end: for loſing the Being which He hath here, to honor Him: He shews, that he holds it for the greateſt happineſs and felicity, if his Father thinks it fit, to be annihilated for his ſervice.</p>
            <p n="7">7. This auguſt Sacrifice being ſo glorious, and pleaſing to God cannot fail to be extreamly profitable and advantagious to men.

            <head>DISCOURS XLVII. OF THE THREE PARTS OF PENANCE.</head>
            <p n="1">1. <seg rend="decorInit">A</seg>Mongſt many expreſſions which the holy Ghoſt vſes in the ſcripture, to make us conceive the maligne and monſtrous nature of ſin, one of the moſt natural, is the compariſon of an impoſtume.</p>
            <p>An impoſtume is a corruption of flesh and blood in our bodys, which makes a ſtinking ſmell; ſin is a corruption of reaſon, and of vertue in our ſouls, which cauſe a ſtink unſupportable to God and his Angells; <hi>They are corrupted, and made abominable ſays</hi> the Royal Prophet. All Surgeons will tell you, and daily ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience <note place="margin">
                  <hi>Pſal.</hi> 13. 1.</note> shews it, that to cu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>e an impoſtume, three things are neceſſary. Firſt, it muſt be cut with a lancet; ſecondly the cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption muſt be forced out; in the third place, it muſt be bound up, oyls and unguents being applyed to it. Such like are the three parts of penance ſo often repeated, and ſo ill practiſed; Contrition is the cut of the lancet; Confeſſion is that which brings out the corruption; Satisfaction is the application of the unguents and binders. Theſe are the 3. Acts neceſſary to cure the ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual, but horrible impoſtume of ſin, of which I shal treat in this Diſcours; In which omitting the Queſtions of Scholaſticks I propoſe only Verities drawn out of Scripture, and Councills of the Church.</p>
            <p n="2">2. Firſt then it is certain, that 'tis abſolutely neceſſary to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent after ſin: that without repentance, there is no pardon, no grace of God, no hope of ſalvation, whatſoever Confeſſion, or Satis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction you do make: whatever abſolution is given you: Whatſoever indulgence or Iubily is granted you. If you want this repentance, alſo without your fault: though alſo you think you have it, if you have it not
<pb n="280" facs="tcp:108789:145"/> in effect, there is no Sacrament nor abſolution profitable. And certainly Abſolution is not more efficacious: and requires not leſs diſpoſition than Baptiſme; But to receive profitably Baptiſme, if we be in mortal ſin, we muſt have ſorrow for it; for in the ſecond and third chapter of the Acts, S. Peter having made a pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erfull predication, and his Auditours being moved, inquired of him: <hi>what ought we to do, to obtain pardon of our ſins?</hi> He anſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wered, <hi>do Penance, and receive Baptiſme.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The Councell of Trent aſſures us, that penance hath been in all times neceſſary, to obtain pardon of ſins. And this is ſo certen that Divines conclude, that a Martyr, a man that goes to ſuffer death for the Faith of IESUS CHRIST, if he remember that he is in mortal ſin, is oblig'd to make a formal and expreſs Act of penance: and that in defect of it his Martyrdom will avail him nothing. With more reaſon this formal act of penance is abſolutely neceſſary to receive abſolution; For the councills declare that the Acts of the Penitent are the matter of this Sacrament, without which the Sacrament ſubſiſts not, and is null; and amongſt theſe acts, the firſt, the principal, and moſt eſſential is repentance. And hence it coms, that 'tis a great Sin, and Sacriledg to confeſs without ſorrow, though you have but venial ſins: it would be much better, if you have no other, to ſay our Lords prayer, and to communicate without confeſſion, than to confeſs without repentance.</p>
            <p n="3">3. Now ſince it is not ſo eaſy to have in your heart true ſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row and regret for daily defects, and a ſincere and effective pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe to amend theſe venial ſins: take this counſell, worthy to be put in practiſe; if you have but theſe leſſer ſins, add to the end of your confeſſion ſome great ſin of your paſt life, for which you have more ſorrow and repentance; in this caſe the abſolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion will fall upon that ſin, not upon the venial ſins, of which you have no ſorrow, or true purpoſe of amendment.</p>
            <p n="4">4. Secondly the Councell of Trent does teach us that this imper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect ſorrow which is called Attrition ought to be ſupernatural, it muſt be a gift of God, and a motion of rhe holy Ghoſt And in the firſt Canon of the ſixt ſeſſion, they pronounce Anathema againſt all that shal dare ſay, <hi>a man without the prevening inſpira<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>
               </hi>
               <pb n="281" facs="tcp:108789:145"/> 
               <hi>ration of the holy Ghoſt; can believe, hope, love, and repent as be ought, to receive the grace of juſtification.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="5">5. This Doctrine condemnes the practiſe of thoſe, Who uſe great diligence in examining their conſcience: but little or none, in procuring covenient ſorrow; <hi>That</hi> is good and neceſſary: but <hi>This</hi> is the more important; if you fail in <hi>that</hi> a little, a good confeſſor may ſupply by asking and examining you; but if you have not <hi>this:</hi> none can give it you: it belongs to God only to beſtow it on you: and you ought to employ time, care, affection, and fervour to obtaine it.</p>
            <p n="6">6. In the third place, the Council declares, that ſupernatural At<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trition, <note place="margin">
                  <hi>ſſ.</hi> 14. <hi>c.</hi> 4.</note> leaves us in the ſtate of ſin, if it be not actually fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed by the abſolution of a Prieſt. If you are ſurprized by the Article of death in the ſtate of mortal ſin, having Attrition only, it avails you nothing to uſe all diligence to have one, if in effect he coms not and abſolves you; dying you are loſt: doubt not of it, for 'tis on Article of Faith. You will ſay: God ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver obliges to a thing impoſſible: shal I be damn'd for want of abſolution, ſince it was not my fault, having uſed all poſſible means to have it? I anſwer: you shal not be damn'd for any ſin you commit, in that you are depriv'd of abſolution: but you shal be, for the precedent ſin, of which you cannot have a remedy, but by perfect Contrition, or by Attrition with abſolution.</p>
            <p>And this is not only the doctrine of the Councel of Trent, and preſent Church: it was the beliefe of the primitive Chriſtians: as may be ſeen in the 180. Epiſtle of S Auguſtin.</p>
            <p n="7">7. But to receive this neceſſary Abſolution and cure from your ſpiritual Phyſician, you muſt open your infirmity to him; when you have lanced your heart with sharp Contrition or Attrition: you muſt make all the corruption of mortal ſins iſſue out of it, by an entire Confeſſion.</p>
            <p n="8">8. Some ſay: 'Tis not neceſſary to confeſs all to a Sinner: 'tis impoſſible to declare this ſin: but I will have true repentance of it, give alms, and do great penances, and God will pardon me.</p>
            <p>Deceive not your ſelves: God will not be a lyar, to be merci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full <note place="margin">
                  <hi>S. Iohn.</hi> 22.</note> to you; He ſayd to Prieſts, <hi>whoſe ſins you shal remit, are remitted: And whoſe you shal retaine are retained.</hi> The ſins which
<pb n="282" facs="tcp:108789:146"/> you know you have committed, and declare not to a Prieſt, are not remitted by him; and if he remits them not, they are retai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, and God will never pardon them. This hath ever been the ſenſe of the Vniverſal Church; She always vnderſtood, that in thoſe words of JESUS CHRIST, which containe the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitution of this Sacrament, was inſtituted also and commanded an entire confeſſion of mortal ſins, as the Councell of Trent declared. Wherefore S. Auſtin preaching to ſinners ſayd, <hi>flatter not your ſel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ves,</hi> 
               <note place="margin">
                  <hi>ſſ.</hi> 14. <hi>c.</hi> 5 <hi>S. Aug. hom.</hi> 49. <hi>ex.</hi> 50.</note> 
               <hi>Say not I confeſs in my heart, I confeſs to God; this is not enough: for ſo in vain the Son of God would have ſayd to Prieſts: All that you shal vnbind on earth shal be unbound in heaven.</hi> And in effect, who would go to Prieſts, if by confeſſing to God alone they could obtain remiſſion? And again, <hi>Be thou ſorrowfull before Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion: Confeſs, let all the matter and putrefaction run out in Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion: now exult, and rejoyce, that which remaines, will eaſily be heald.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="9">9. By this we may underſtand; why ſo many confeſs, and ſo few are amended: why ſo many receive this Sacrament, and ſo few profit by it? One great reaſon is, that many make not a true, perfect, and entire Confeſſion. This defect hinders the operation of ſo great a Caus, and makes the Sacrament inva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lid or unprofitable. It happens either through negligence, igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance, or shame.</p>
            <p n="8">8. Firſt through negligence; They examin, and Confeſs only the actions which they have don, and not thoſe which they ought to do, and have not don; they confeſs the ſins of their perſone: and not thoſe of their condition: ſins which they committed: and not thoſe which others committed by their occaſion.</p>
            <p n="9">9. Secondly, through Ignorance: For they muſt not think to be excuſed ſaying, I have not confeſt ſuch ſins; becaus I thought not to do ill; if you omit any ſin through groſs igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cance, or through culpable blindneſs, God ſays to you in the ſcripture, <hi>If you know not, you shal not be known. Becaus thou haſt</hi> 
               <note place="margin">1. <hi>Cor.</hi> 14. 38. <hi>Oſee,</hi> 4. 6.</note> 
               <hi>repelled knowledg, I will repell thee.</hi> If this ignorance or blindneſs be in you becaus you pray not God enough to enlighten you, and make you know what diſpleaſes him; or becaus you have thruſt your ſelf into an office, of which you are uncapable: or becaus
<pb n="283" facs="tcp:108789:146"/> you hear not ſermons, nor read good books, which may inſtruct you: nor deſire that any one should tell you your faults, you are not excuſed in the ſight of God, for not confeſſing them.</p>
            <p n="10">10. Thirdly through shame; which makes us to conceal vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luntarily ſome ſin, moſt perniciouſly, and criminally: This want of integrity is pernicious: ſince the Wiſe-man ſays, <hi>He that hides</hi> 
               <note place="margin">
                  <hi>Prov.</hi> 28. 13.</note> 
               <hi>his ſin cannot be corrected, nor directed in the way of Salvation.</hi> How can a Phyſician cure an infirmity hidden and unknown? and how can the infirme be directed in the way of health, when he hath not yet begun the way? For the beginning of a good life is a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion of the evill, ſays S. Auſtin.</p>
            <p>It is likewiſe moſt criminal: for 'tis not only in its ſelf a great crime: but makes you to commit many other Sacriledges afterward in Confeſſions: Sacriledges in communions: and ſins upon ſins: which will caſt you into deſpair, and into the mouth of hell. But if you ſubmit to the humiliation and shame which you have me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rited, and confeſs entirely: you rejoyce the the Angells, and your Confeſſours with them: you pleaſe the Son of God, who deſires nothing more, than to pardon thoſe, who being penitent con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſs perfectly their ſins.</p>
            <p n="11">11. Let us com to Satisfaction, which is the third part of pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance, and neceſſary to ſatisfy the juſtice of God, and to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleat the cure of our ſouls. For true penance is not that which the Calviniſts do ſay; perfect penance is not only that, which many Catholicks do think. Calviniſts ſay, that to do penance is to leave ſinning and to amend ones life. This is neceſſary: but it ſuffices not. many Catholicks thinke, to do penance, is to be ſorrowfull for ſins, to confeſs them to a Prieſt, receive abſolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and to ſay a few prayers; All this is neceſſary: but 'tis not enough. To do entire and perfect Penance, which appeaſes God, averts his anger, regains his favours, and delivers us from the dreadfull effects of ſin: we muſt ſatisfy the juſtice of God, by humble and fervent prayers, by auſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rities and painfull works, according to the multitude, enormity and diverſity of our offences. For as often as the holy ſcripture ſpeaks of penance, it makes mention of works which afflict the flesh, mortify ſenſuality, and which are contrary to ſelf love. In
<pb n="284" facs="tcp:108789:147"/> Ioel, <hi>Convert your ſelves to me in faſting, and in weeping, and in</hi>

               <hi>mourning.</hi> In S. Matthew: <hi>If in Tyre and Sydon had been wrought the miracles that have been wrought in you, they had don penance in haire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cloth and in aſhes long ago.</hi> And S. Paul ſays, <hi>The ſorrow which is according to God, workes in us reveng:</hi> by which we punish ſin in our own ſelves. Wherefore S. Auſtin tells us, <hi>That 'tis not enough to change the evill life into a better, and to depart from paſt ſins, if we do not ſatisfy God, by the regrets of penance, by humble groanes, by faſts, and by Alms.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="12">12. The primitive Chriſtians were ſo firmly perſwaded of this Verity, that to avoyd the Vengeance of God, and to ſatisfy his Iuſtice, they willingly ſubmitted to publick Penance: in which they endured ſo many humiliations, mortifications, and confuſions that it would ſeem incredible, were it not atteſted by ſo great authority, that we may not doubt of it.</p>
            <p n="13">13. I know well, that thoſe rigorous obſervances are not now in uſe; nevertheleſs they shew what was the ſentiment of thoſe great Saints, who were the Diſciples of the Apoſtles, or the Diſciples of their Diſciples: who had the ſpirit of God: who read the Scriptures day and night: who propagated the Church and watered it with their ſweat and bood. Thoſe obſervances ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ke known, that 'tis not ſo eaſy to appeaſe God, and to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain full pardon, as we imagin: and that we we muſt employ ordinarily more than one hour, one day, or week, to regaine his ancient favours, and what we loſt by ſin.</p>
            <p n="14">14. And to know that the preſent Church retaines the Spirit of the primitive: read the Councill of Trent, and you will ſee the Fathers <note place="margin">
                  <hi>Ss.</hi> 24, <hi>de Refor c.</hi> 8.</note> order publick penance to be impoſed for publick crimes, if the Bishops diſpence not with it. And in the 14th. ſs. chap. 8. they declare to Prieſts if through timerouſneſs, or too much condeſcen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence, and humane reſpects, they give little penance for great crimes, they make themſelves partakers of the ſins of others. See if we are not in great danger, and if we have not great reaſon to fear, that we shal fall into the dreadfull hands of God? What quarrells, what drunkenneſſes, what ſcandals are com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted daily? And what great penances are impoſed for ſo many, ſo great, and enormous Crimes?</p>
            <p n="15">
               <pb n="285" facs="tcp:108789:147"/> 15. But behold a doctrine of great Conſolation, which the Council of Trent does teach us. 'Tis that we may Satisfy the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine juſtice, not only by the penances which the Confeſſor im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſes: <note place="margin">
                  <hi>Ss.</hi> 14. C. 9</note> not only by the prayers, faſts, alms, auſterities, and mortifications which we aſſume voluntarily of our ſelves: but more<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>over by all the humiliations and aflictions that befall us, if we receive them as we ought. When then God vouchſafes to ſend you Croſſes and afflictions: receive them, not only with patience and reſignation, but with ioy and thankfullneſs: kiſs the hand that chaſtiſes you: and adore the Juſtice that punishes you in this world to ſpare you in the other. Say with the Prophet Micheas<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 
               <hi>Iram Domini portabo quoniam peccavi ei.</hi> I will ſuffer the anger of God, <note place="margin">

            <p n="16">16. Let us conclude this Diſcour<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> with the words of the belo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved Diſciple: <hi>Haec Scribo vobis ut non peccetis;</hi> Be very carefull that you offend not God: 'tis the greateſt evill that can befall you; as often as you conſent to a mortal ſin, you put your ſelf in danger of damnation; for you may die in this ſtate without ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolution. You imagin that in this occaſion you are ſecure of your ſalvation, provided that you have time to ſay, my God I aske you pardon! you deceive your ſelf; for if you cannot have a Prieſt: you muſt neceſſarily have perfect contrition: and this is moſt hard and rare; And if you have a Prieſt, it helps you no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing without Attrition: and you cannot have Attrition of your ſelf: 'tis neceſſary that God do give it you by his powerfull grace: and He owes you not this grace: you have demerited it by your ſin: He hath not promiſed it to you: and hath refuſed it to many.</p>
            <p>But if by humane frailty you have ſinned, and averted your ſelf from God: beg inſtantly and humbly his grace through the me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits of JESUS CHRIST to returne to Him by a true Conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion; Returne by true ſorrow for having offended a moſt ado<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable, moſt amiable, and moſt dreadfull Majeſty; Returne by an humble, ſincere, and entire confeſſion; Returne by a ſatiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction of Prayers Faſts, and Alms; you will be delivered from a moſt dangerous malady: from a moſt infamous ſervitude: from

You will recover ſanctifying grace: the gifts of the holy Ghoſt: the merits of your goods works; the Angells will rejoyce upon it in heaven: the Faithfull will be edifyd upon earth: Devills will rage for envy in hell. The eternal Father will adopt you for his child: the Son will make you one of his members: the holy Ghoſt will dwell in you as in his Temple; The B.

            <p>S. Peter in the new Teſtament furnishes us with a ſtrong proof of Purgatory in the third chapter of his firſt Epiſtle: He teaches us, that the Son of God deſcended, and <hi>Preached to them that were in priſon, who had been incredulous ſometime in the days of Noah.</hi> This paſſage connot be applyd to the Fathers that were detain'd in Limbo. nor to the damned that were lockt up in hell. For the firſt never were incrudulous, as were thoſe to whom the Son of God did ſpeak. The ſecond deſerv'd not that IESUS CHRIST should preach, or <hi>Evangelize</hi> as the text ſays good news to them, or should mitigate their torments by the happineſs of his preſence: Since according to the Scripture, in hell there is no redemption. It remaines then that He ſpeaks of the Souls in Purgatory, and of thoſe particularly, that gave not credit to the preaching of Noah: who nevertheleſs being moved by the deluge, and by the preſent perill, called upon God, and converted themſelves to him by pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance; But to Expiate the paines due to their ſins, were doom'd to priſon, and to punishment until the comming of the Redeemer: who preached to them the grace of Redemption: drew them out of priſon, and led them with Him into Heaven.</p>

            <p>But if we should have nither Scripture nor Tradition for this Verity: yet common ſenſe would teach it. For let us ſuppoſe that there is a man, as there may be, who having committed blaſphemies murders, adulteries, and other ſins in great number, and being upon his death-bed, repents, converts himſelf to God, and dyes; whither shal his ſoul go?

            <p n="3">3. Wherefore a ſoul in Purgatory murmures not: she com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plains not of too much rigour: on the contrary she embraces and ſuffers thoſe torments voluntarily: she knows how diſagreable she is to the Sanctity and Purity of God: that she is a debtour to his juſtice: and that she deſerves thoſe torments: she deſires the juſtice of God should have its cours: and as she loves God more than her own ſelf: she is glad, the injury don to his Majeſty is revenged, alſo at her own coſt; she will rema<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ine in that priſon untill her debt be entirely payd, either by her own ſufferances: or by the satisfactions and ſuffrages of others.</p>
            <p n="4">4. For we may ayde thoſe poor afflicted ſoules; they are in communion of ſpiritual goods with us: they are members of the ſame myſtical Body, children of the ſame Church, Citizens of the ſame City; and there is ſuch an union, ſuch a ſimpathy, and commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nication betwixt members of the ſame Body, children of the ſame family, inhabitants of the ſame City, that we cauterize a mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber that is well, to cure that which is ill: that the labour of a child of a family profits his brother who labours not: that one citizen <note place="margin">

            <p>Secondly, by the Sacrifice of Maſs; for this is the moſt <note place="margin">

            <p>Thirdly by Alms. Venerable Toby ſayd to his ſon, <hi>Put your bread and wine upon the Tomb of the juſt;</hi> becaus in that time the Poor aſſembled in Cemeterys or Churchyards, and alms of bread and wine were given them, for the ſouls departed; <hi>He ſais, upon the Tomb of the juſt:</hi> becaus alms g<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

For if one of your children dye, are you more charitable than you were? if you keep your goods for them you would ſend a part to him: he hath now more need of it then ever.</hi> But if you have not means to give alms for the poor ſouls, ſuccour them by other workes.</p>
            <p n="5">5. All vertuous actions don in the ſtate of grace, and eſpecially the painfull, if Offered for the dead, give them great refreshment. But thoſe confort them moſt, of which they are the Cauſe either by their inſtructions, or by their good examples. For Divinity <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

            <p n="6">6.

If then we are depriv'd of it by our fault: or if we receive the Sacrament unfruitfully: or if by our negligence a Soul depart out of this world without receiving the grace of it, 'tis a great fault, and God does make this complaint of it, <hi>The wound is not sured, nor mollifyd with oyle.</hi>

               <seg rend="decorInit">H</seg>Itherto we have treated of Sacraments which were inſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuted to ſanctify men in particular: now we ſpeak of the Sacrament of Order, inſtituted for the General good, publick Order, Government, and Miniſtery of the Ch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>urch. And becaus Diſſenters deny it to be a Sacrament, we will shew in the firſt place that 'tis a true one; Secondly we will con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider, what this ſacred Signe does ſignify: and in the third pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ce the Documents we ought to draw from thence, for the glory of God, the Salvation of our Souls, and the guidance of our lives.</p>
            <p n="1">1. A Sacrament is an exteriour and ſenſible ſigne, by which grace of the holy Ghoſt is given him that receives it worthily. Now the Apoſtle S. Paul, and after him the general Councell of Cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cedon ſay expreſſly, that grace of the holy Ghoſt is conferr'd in Ordination by impoſition of hands. <hi>Neglect not the grace that is in</hi> 
               <note place="margin">1. <hi>Tim.</hi> 4. 14. 2. <hi>Tim.</hi> 1. 6. <hi>Concil: calced an.</hi> 451. <hi>Act.</hi> 1 5. <hi>can</hi> 2</note> 
               <hi>thee: which is given thee by Prophecie, with impoſition of the hands of Prieſthood. I admonish thee that thou reſuſſitate the grace of God, which is in thee by the impoſition of my hands.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Hence the Councells and ancient Fathers have always acknowled<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged Ordination for a true and proper Sacrament; and therefore in the general Councell of Florence this is numbred with them, both Grecians and Latins approving it. I might Fill pages with Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations of the holy Fathers: But this of great S, Auſtine will ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ce: He in his ſecond book againſt the Epiſtle of Parmenean pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ves againſt the Donatiſts, that the Sacrament of Order cannot be loſt, becaus Baptiſme cannot: <hi>Let them Explicate,</hi> ſays He, <hi>how</hi>
               <pb n="299" facs="tcp:108789:154"/> 
               <hi>the Sacrament of the the Baptized cannot be loſt, and the Sacrament of the Orderer may be? For if both of them be Sacraments, of which nobody doubts, why cannot that be loſt, if this may be?</hi> Here he calls Orders a Sacrament: He shews it to be a proper and true one by comparing it whith Baptiſme; He aſſures us that nobody doub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted of this Verity: and if S. Auſtin may be credited, not only all the Writers of his time, but alſo all the Faithfull did believe the ſame.</p>
            <p n="2">2. This external and ſacred ſigne expreſſes two ſingular favours which Eccleſiaſticks receive from God in their conſecration. The firſt is the higheſt dignity in the World. For to a Prieſt is given Power over the natural Body of IESUS CHRIST: to conſecta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>te, and offer, and diſtribute it; and over his myiſtical Body, which is the Church, to remit ſins, adminiſter Sacraments and to do the ſacred functions of the characters imprinted in him; A Power ſo much more excellent, eminent, and higher than other Dignities, as the Spirit than the Body: Heaven than Earth: Divine things than humane: and as Eternal than temporal.</p>
            <p>S. Paul ſays 'tis certaine by the conſent of all the world, <note place="margin">
                  <hi>Heb.</hi> 7. 4.</note> that he who hath right to give his Benediction to ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, is more noble and high than he, <hi>ſine ulla contradictione quod minus eſt a meliore benedicitur.</hi> But a Prieſt gives his Benediction to Princes, Kings, and Emperours: his Dignity then is more high.</p>
            <p>S. Chryſoſtome exhorting Prieſts to refuſe Abſolution and Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion <note place="margin">
                  <hi>S. Chry. Hom.</hi> 3. <hi>in Matt. Hom. ad</hi> 60. <hi>pop. An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioch.</hi>
               </note> to all that are unworthy, though they be Princes or Kings ſays to them: you ought to do it, and you can do it; you ought to do it; otherwiſe, IESUS CHRIST will exact of you an account of his Blood, and will puniſh you moſt terribly; You can do it, for your Power is greater than that of Princes of this world.</p>
            <p>If you ſuſpect the Teſtimony of this Saint becaus he was a Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>late of the Church: hear the Prince of the world. The Emperor Baſil in an oration he made to his people, in the eighth general <note place="margin">
                  <hi>Baron. An:</hi> 869. <hi>nn.</hi> 55.</note> Councell: <hi>It belongs not to us Laymen to medle with the things of the Church, it belongs to Prieſts, and Prelats who have power to ſanctify us, to open heaven to us, and shut it againſt us, to bind us, or els to to abſol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ve</hi>
               <pb n="300" facs="tcp:108789:155"/> 
               <hi>us. Our condition is to be fed as sheep, to be ſanctifyd, conducted, and unbound.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>You will not thinke the words of theſe Great men ſtrange, or that they exagerate the Greatneſs of Prieſtly Power: if you conſider that it ſurpaſſes the ſpiritual Power as well as the temporal; di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine as well as humane. For popes who excell in Authority and Grandeure, if conſidered not as as Prieſts, are leſs in Power than theſe. For the Power of Prieſts extends upon the natural Body of IESUS CHRIST, and that of Popes upon his myſtical Body only, which is his Church: and therefore as much as his natural Body exceeds his myſtical, ſo much the Prieſtly Power ſurmounts the Papal. S. John Baptiſt, who ſurpaſſed all men: who was the greateſt that had riſen among the ſons of women for his ſanctity: Yet was leſs in Power than the leaſt Prieſt of the Church: He shewed with his fingar IESUS CHRIST: But Prieſts produce Him in their hands, and give Him for nourishment to others; He only dipoſed the people to penance: and Prieſts abſolve them from their ſins. The Angells, who though they can do great things upon creatures of the world, they cannot put Chriſt at their Will upon the Altar: but are content to adore, love and ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mire Him there; And Prieſts by vertue of their character have this Power: and can offer Him in an unbloody Sacrifice for the ſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation of the Living and the Dead.</p>
            <p n="3">3. This Power of Prieſts being ſo great, God out of his good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs adds in their ordination another favour to it; He whoſe workes are perfect, giving power, gives likewiſe thoſe things th<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>at are requiſite for the legitimate and convenient uſe of it. He replenishes Prieſts with abundant grace to make them worthy of their Character, to exerciſe well the functions of it, and to ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>det them capable to ſanctify the faithfull. <hi>Noli negligere gratiam, quae data eſt tibi per impoſitionem manuum Preſbiterij. Idoneos nos fecit Miniſtros.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="4">4. Theſe particular favours which IESUS does to Prieſts, admo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nish us of the Honour we are oblig'd to render them. <hi>Honour God with all thy ſoul, and honour Prieſts,</hi> ſays Eccleſiaſticus. And S. Paul, <hi>Prieſts that do well their duty, deſerve double honor.</hi> 'Tis by them ſays S. Hierome, that we are converted and made Chriſtians: by
<pb n="301" facs="tcp:108789:155"/> them we are received into the Church: by them we are delivered from our ſins: we reenter into the grace and favour of God: by them we receive his bleſſings, enjoy the precious Body of IESUS, and offer to God the dreadfull ſacrifice: by them in fine the Sacraments are adminiſtred, and the imperial heaven is opened to us. We muſt not neglect them who are the Judges of Kings in the proceſs of eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity: them who the Prophet Malachy ſays, <hi>are the Angells of our Lord.</hi> 
               <note place="margin">
                  <hi>Malac,</hi> 2. 7. <hi>Exod.</hi> 22. 28.</note> Them, whom God himſelf calls Gods: becaus they are his Vice-Roys, Officers of his Crown, His Miniſters of ſtate: Secretaries of his com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandements: Iudges of his people: Embaſſadors of his Majeſty: Mediators between God and men: who announce the will of God to men, and who preſent the deſires of men to God. We reſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect Embaſſadors, alſo thoſe of barbarous and infidell Kings, with much more reaſon thoſe which the king of Kings does ſend to us, sayd S. Chryſoſtome.</p>
            <p n="5">5. To create in our hearts a great reſpect to Prieſts: Some al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leadg the example of wiſe Salomon, who ſayd to Abiather the Prieſt: you are guilty of death: but I will not condemne you: becaus you have carried the Arke. Or the Example of Conſtantine the Great: who in the Councel of Nice would not ſit down, but after all the Bishops, and upon a little ſeat below them all. And when one preſented to him papers of complaints againſt ſome Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſts: he burnt them without reading them, and being angry with the perſone that gave them to him, ſayd, it belongs to Prieſts to judg Emperours, and not to Emperours, to judg and condemn Prieſts: and should I ſee a Prieſt commit a ſin, I would cover him with my Royal cloak, for fear that any one should ſee him.</p>
            <p>Other propoſe the example of S. Antony. This great Saint! this Patriarke of ſo many thouſands of Anchorets that lived like Angells! This great Antony, of whoſe amity Emperours made ſo great account: This Antony whome wild beaſts obeyed; at whoſe Name Devills trembled: whoſe life converted ſo many Souls to God; This great S. Antony, I say, honoured ſo much Prieſts, that if he met the leaſt of them, he fell upon his knees, and roſe not up, till he had received his benediction.</p>
            <p>Or of the Seraphicall Father S. Francis, who ſayd, that if he should meet an Angel, and a Prieſt: he would rather kiſs the hands of the
<pb n="302" facs="tcp:108789:156"/> Prieſt, than of the Angel.</p>
            <p>Or of S. Catherine of Sienna, who kiſſed the wayes and paths in which Prieſts had paſt.</p>
            <p n="6">6. Is it not pity to ſee now that ſome Chriſtians neglect them, or contemne them, under pretence that ſome of them are vicious? If it be ſo: does it pertain to them to ſpeak of their vices? are they judges of their Judges? are they wiſer than Salomon: grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter than Conſtantine: more devout than S. Antony: more fervent than S. Francis: more innocent than S. Catherine: and more zealous of the honor of God, than God himſelf? Who ſayd by his Prophet, Touch not my annointed. <note place="margin">

            </p>
            <p n="7">7. Let us take heed Venerable Prieſts and honourable Fathers that we be not the cauſe, or at leaſt the occaſion of this teme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity: that by our indevotions and immodeſties, by our irreverence in the Chruch, and our converſations with the world, we be not the cauſe of the little reſpect now given to our character and vocation. <hi>How is the gold darkned and the beſt coulour changed,</hi> ſays the Prophet Hieremie? Whats becom of that ſplendour, that luſter, <note place="margin">

How is all this ſo decayed and obſcured? Tis becaus, then they ſaw not Prieſts, but at the Altar, in the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſional, or in the pulpit; and now they are ſeen in Taverns, in playhouſes, and in worldly companies.</p>
            <p>IESUS ſays to us, <hi>you are the light of the world;</hi> we muſt shine ſo then, that men may ſee our good workes: and may be moved to glorify our Father which is in heaven. But if our light be darkneſs: if we falſify by our actions Chriſts Doctrine and maxims: this ill example of one of us will ruine more the piety of the Faithfull, than many other by their doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trine and good examples will be able to repair.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>You are the salt of the earth;</hi> salt is drawn out of water: but if it be reunited to it: it diſolves, and loſes the propriety it had to prevent corruption; a Prieſt is ſeperated from the people by his conſecration: if he rejoyn himſelf to them by a worldly converſation: he loſes the authority which he had to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve them from the corruption of ſin.</p>
            <pb n="303" facs="tcp:108789:156"/>
            <p> We are judges of others: we muſt not be criminall; God will examin us more axactly, judg us more ſeverely, and pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nish us more rigorouſly.</p>
            <p>SAVIOR IESUS high Prieſt and Paſtor of our ſols, permit not that we give you caus to do it: permit not, that it may be truly ſayd, <hi>as the people ſo the Prieſt;</hi> you are our inheritance, our Lot, and our Portion: permit not that our inheritance per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain to others more than to us. Make that our mouthes be not em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployed but to reſound your praiſes: that our comportment and our manners do expreſs and repreſent your actions: that our hearts be not enflam'd, but in your love.

The anci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent Iſraelites had the liberty to repudiate their wives, if they did not pleaſe them: Poligamy was permitted them: they had ſacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice, and the water of Iealoſy to try the fidelity of their wives. All theſe things having not been tollerated but by condeſcendence to that rude people, IESUS CHRIST abrogated them; and in this rendred marriage much more burdenſome, and aggravated the yoke. Now ſince his Law is a Law of grace and ſweetneſs
<pb n="303" facs="tcp:108789:157"/> ſince. He ſays, <hi>his yoke is ſweet, and his burden light.</hi> it concern'd Him to recompence and eaſe married Chriſtians by the abundant graces which He gives them in this Sacrament. Yes, in vertue of this Sacrament, God gives you in the reſt of your daies, in divers occaſions, moſt great and powerfull graces (if you put no obſtacle) to reſiſt temptations: to conduct well your family, to bring up your children in the fear of God: to endure pati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ently each others imperfections: and to ſupport the other burdens and inconveniences of marriage; and they depriue themſelves of all theſe graces, who marry in an ill ſtate, in the ſtate of mortal ſin.</p>
            <p n="6">6. This Sacrament being a ſymbole and a repreſentation of the marriage of Ieſus with his Church, muſt imitate and expreſs it. In conſequence to the alliance of JESVS with his Church, there is betwixt them mutual tradition and communication of Bodys, of Spirit, and of Fortune. IESUS as the Eſpouſe of the Church, gives her his precious Body: and takes ours: He ioyns them to His, and makes of them his Members. The Calviniſts ſay, that IESUS CHRIST is not in the Euchariſt; they ſay true: He is not in their Euchariſt: He gives not his body to their pretended Church: He delivers not his precious flesh to any other but his Spouſe; 'Tis only the Romane Church: 'tis this true and legiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mate Spouſe: 'tis this only one and well beloved that enioys this Priviledg infallibly, only, and perpetually.</p>
            <p n="7">7. The Lawyer ſayd, and it is true, that a wife ought to <note place="margin">lege ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſus. Cod. de crimine explicatae hered.</note> enter into ſociety with her huſband, not only in humane things, but moreover in divine: <hi>ſocia rei humanae &amp; divinae.</hi> And IESUS con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tents not himſelf to give his humane body to the Church, but gives his di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Spirit, the holy Ghoſt: and you know that the holy Ghoſt is love and charity by the propriety of his Perſone, and by the condition of his emanation. S. Paul then hath reaſon to ſay <hi>Husbands love your wives, as Chriſt alſo loved the Church and delivered himſelf for it, that He might Sanctify it.</hi> A huſband then muſt love his wife as JESUS loves his Church, with a ſincere and cordial love, ſpeaking to her with an open heart: communicating to her his deſignes, aſſociating her in his enterprizes, as IESUS hath revealed to his Church <hi>all that Ho received from his Father,</hi> and aſſociated her to all his
<pb n="304" facs="tcp:108789:158"/> operations, alſo to the production of grace. A wife muſt love, and alſo reverence or honor (as the Apoſtle ſays) her huſband, as the Church loves and honours IESUS CHRIST: she muſt love and <note place="margin">
                  <hi>Ephes.</hi> 25</note> honor the parents and friends of her huſband, as the Church loves and honours the Virgin, Mother of her Eſpouſe, S. Iames and other Saints his friends. Huſband and Wife muſt love mutually one another with a true and pure love, not with an inordinate, ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuall, or worldly love, as they do, who procure each other what is honourable or profitable upon earth, though with eminent danger of loſing heaven: who eſpouſe the paſſions, reveng the quarrells, pleaſe the ſenſes, and ſatisfy the foolish and inordinate inclinations of each other, to the great prejudice of their ſouls, and their Salvation.</p>
            <p n="8">8. Chriſt loved not ſo, his Church: He loved not ſo his Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, his Apoſtles, Martyrs, Confeſſors, and other friends: but loved them in order to everlaſting life. Wherefore if you will love well, love as Chriſt hath loved us: love in order to everlaſting life: cut off occaſions of ſin: ſeek occaſions to do each other good, to make one another vertuous, and procure by prayers; exhortations, and good examples the ſalvation of each other.</p>
            <p n="9">9. S. Paul deſires that the man be ſo holy, and give ſo good example to his wife, that he convert her, if she be an infidell: and that the wife in like manner by her holy converſation do ſanctify her husband, though he should be a pagan and ido<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>later. <note place="margin">1. <hi>Cor.</hi> 7. 14.</note> This will never be don by dunning him with complaints, reproaches, invectives, or with other outcryes; but as S. Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nica converted her husband, enduring patiently his injuries, ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porting his inperfections, never anſwering him when he was in anger, ſpeaking to him of God, more by her good example than by her words, shewing him to the end, a ſincere, faithfull, and conſtant love.</p>
            <p n="10">10. IESUS CHRIST ſayd to the perſecutors of his Church, why do you perſecute me? ſo much He participates in the affli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions of his Church; The Church partakes alſo in the ſuffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rances of IESUS: she is ſorrowfull, afflicted, mortifyd, when she conſiders Him in his Death and Paſſion; ſo all ought to be common amongſt married perſons, good things and bad, joy
<pb n="305" facs="tcp:108789:158"/> and ſorrow, pleaſure and diſpleaſure: and this will much conduce to the honor of ſo great a Sacrament, which S. Paul ſays is worthy of all reſpect.</p>
            <p n="11">11. <hi>Honorabile Connubium in omnibus:</hi> Marriage honourable in all. This is not to ſay, among all men, as Diſſenters tranſlate: Els <note place="margin">
                  <hi>Heb.</hi> 13. 4.</note> the marriage of a Brother with his Siſter would be honourable; and that of thoſe who have vowed continence, to whom the ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>me Apoſtle ſays, <hi>'tis damnable:</hi> But <hi>in all things:</hi> that is, in all its Parts, Circumſtances, and Appurtenances. Honor it in the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention you have to marry; for if it be bad and vicious, all the ſequel will be corrupted. will you know why God is not in the marriage of many? Tis becaus they married not for the love of him: they married for carnal or fond love, for ſenſuall pleaſure: through ambition to have this man who is in credit, or through avarice to have a rich Party. <hi>If two are aſſembled in my name,</hi> ſays our Saviour, <hi>I will be in the midſt of them;</hi> He is not in the midſt of thoſe: becaus they were not aſſembled in his name<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> This ought to be the intention of Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans, ſays S.
